Adelebsen,1675,192 in 1861,32,"Although individual Jewish merchants settled in the area with ducal permission before the nineteenth century, it was only in the early 1800s that enough Jews lived in Adelebsen to warrant the establishment of a prayer hall (located in a private home). In 1836, the community built a synagogue with 100 seats (50 for men, 50 for women), schoolrooms and living quarters for a teacher, who also functioned as chazzan and shochet. Adelebsen Jews, initially cattle dealers and dry goods merchants, eventually branched out into other industries and trades; the town was home to a Jewish-owned weaving mill, veterinary clinic and, for a short period, a Jewish doctor. The community also maintained several Jewish organizations, e.g., a charity association (founded in 1850), a chevra kadisha (founded in 1889) and a male choir. The cemetery was vandalized in 1929. Later, in response to the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933, many Jews left Adelebsen. In the spring of 1938, two SA officers were indicted and fined, giving the remaining Jews a false sense of security, for the synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night (November 1938) by SS officials from Goettingen; Jewish householders were arrested and abused that night. Adelebsen’s few remaining Jews were deported in 1942. A selection of ritual objects belonging to members of the Adelebsen community is on display in the Goettingen Jewish community house.","Harold Slutzkin Sources: EJL, JGNB, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=80,80
Aach,15th century,86 in 1850,38,"Local Jews conducted services in a prayer hall, which was shared with the Jews of nearby Butzweiler and Welschbillig, until 1860, when the community inaugurated a synagogue at 2 Neweler Strasse. Consecrated in 1600, the cemetery was enlarged in 1930. Exterior of the synagogue of Aachen in or around the year 1900. Courtesy of: City Archive of Aachen. Beginning in the 19th century, the community employed a series of Jewish teachers; later, it was decided that the teacher, who also served as chazzan and shochet, would focus exclusively on religious instruction. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and threw out the Torah scrolls. Jewish homes were heavily damaged, and foodstuffs were thrown out of a Jewish- owned inn. In 1942, the synagogue was forcibly sold to the municipality, after which the building was used as an army stable and, later, as a prison. By 1938, five of the remaining eight Jewish families had immigrated to the United States. Aach’s last 12 Jews were deported to the East in the transports of October 1941, April 1942, July 1942 and March 1943. At least 37 Aach Jews and 10 from Welschbillig perished in the Shoah. The synagogue, sold yet again in 1954, was converted into a residential building two years later. In 1996, however, the building was renovated and declared a public monument, to which a commemorative plaque was affixed in 1998. The restored cemetery also houses a memorial.","Nurit Borut; Sources: AJ, EJL, SLTS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=75,75
Aachen,8th century,"1,665 in 1905","1,348","The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Aachen is from the 8th century, but it was not until the mid-13th century, by which point all Jews had been restricted to living in the town’s Judengasse, that records once again mention Jewish life in Aachen. In or around 1800, when the town was under French rule, local Jews attained civil rights. ￼Members of the modern community conducted services in a prayer room until the establishment, in 1839, of a synagogue, community center and school on Hirschgraben; and, in 1862, of a new, impressive house of worship at 21 Promenadenstrasse (present-day 23 Synagogenplatz). Other communal institutions included a Jewish school (established in 1826) and a cemetery, the latter of which was consecrated on Luetticher Strasse in 1822 and enlarged in 1865 and 1878. (Prior to 1822, burials were conducted in Dueren.) David Rothschild, who served this Liberal congregation between 1850 and 1859, was the community’s first full-time rabbi. Rabbi Theodor Julius held this post between 1876 and 1925. In 1933, Aachen was home to 1,348 Jews. One hundred and four schoolchildren received religious instruction at religious and secondary schools. Around this time, the community maintained a Jewish elementary school (Juedische Volksschule). Numerous welfare associations and foundations provided assistance to children, juveniles, women, the elderly and the poor. Because the National Socialists gained a foothold in Aachen prior to 1933, Jews there were discriminated against before the Nazis’ election victories. Beginning in March 1933, a series of anti-Jewish legislation—dismissing Jews from their jobs, banning them from certain occupations—were put in place. On April 1, 1933, one day after SA men had threatened Jewish shop owners and their customers, the boycott of Jewish businesses was implemented. The persecution intensified in 1935, as a result of which many local Jews immigrated to the Netherlands, Palestine and other countries. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down, Jewish homes and stores were damaged and Jews were publicly beaten. Seventy men were arrested, of whom 60 were sent to Buchenwald and 10 to Sachsenhausen. In 1939, 780 Jews still lived in Aachen, many of whom managed to escape to Holland and Belgium. The remaining Jews were moved to so-called Judenhaeuser (Jewish Houses) in April 1941, after which they were subjected to forced labor and ordered to wear a yellow star badge. Between 1942 and 1944, several deportations left for Theresienstadt and Lublin. At least 845 Aachen Jews perished in the Shoah. After World War II, 25 Jewish survivors returned to Aachen, where a Jewish community center was established on Oppenhoffalle at the end of the 1950s.

A trade registry from 1817 lists nine Jewish families, and we also know that many local Jews left the town during the latter half of the 19th century. The community established a synagogue in 1850 or 1882. Acholshausen was also home to a mikveh and a school for religious studies, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher/shochet who also served the Gaukoenigshofen community; Der Israelit newspaper posted an ad for this position on January 8, 1891. Burials were conducted in Allersheim. As a result of dwindling membership numbers, the Acholshausen Jews eventually lost their status as an autonomous Jewish community. In 1919, the remaining Jews joined the community in Gaukoenigshofen. Although the synagogue was no longer in use on Pogrom Night, rioters nevertheless ravaged the building. In 1944, the heavily damaged structure was destroyed during an air raid. 5 Adelebsen (Lower Saxony) Pogrom Night 1938 ￼Nine Acholshausen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Achim,1746,73 in 1907,37,"The Jewish community of Achim was established in 1844. In 1864, a local Jew financed and built a synagogue on his land, which became community property in 1932. Achim’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1865 (desecrated in 1900), and we also know that, beginning in 1843, a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet served the community. Opened in 1855, the Jewish school became a public elementary school in 1878; the school received its own building in 1907 but was closed in 1924. In 1933, a teacher/chazzan provided religious instruction to six schoolchildren. A women’s association was active in the community, to which the Jews of Ottersberg, Hemelingen and Osten were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed. Rioters broke windows in and plundered Jewish homes; local Jews were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The synagogue was sold to a local merchant in 1939, and in 1944, the cemetery was confiscated and destroyed. Nine Jews emigrated, 14 relocated within Germany and one died in Achim. In November, 1941, nine Jews (one family) were deported to Minsk. A Jewish couple was deported to Theresienstadt in the summer of 1942. Two local Jews—both were married to Gentiles—survived the war in Achim. At least 30 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

The school building, a Jewish-owned business and eight homes (including the teacher’s apartment) were damaged heavily. Jewish men were beaten and humiliated in the synagogue’s yard, but a Christian minister prevented the crowd from pushing a Jew off the synagogue’s gallery. The Jewish men were then deported to Buchenwald; all other Jews were taken to Eschwege. Twenty-six Jews emigrated and 60 relocated within Germany; the others were deported to the East. At least 83 Abterode Jews perished in the Shoah. Sold to a bank in 1944, the synagogue was used as a storage room.

The earliest available record of a cemetery is dated 1809, and we also know that it was consecrated near Dansenberghalle, outside Adorf. In 1832, the community received permission to build a synagogue, which was inaugurated shortly afterwards. Although we know that Adorf was home to a Jewish school in 1872—established in rented quarters on Bergstrasse—the records do not tell us when it was built. In September 1935, windows in Jewish homes were smashed. In 1936/37, 12 Jews relocated within Germany and one immigrated to Brazil; three passed away in Adorf. The synagogue was sold in 1937, and in 1938 the community was disbanded. Ritual objects from the synagogue were transferred to Kassel. Despite this, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed. The building was demolished in 1939. Three Jews lived in Adorf in 1941: Two moved to Wrexen in November of that year; and one (possibly married to a Christian) remained in Adorf and died there in 1947.

Adelsberg,15th century,64 in 1816,21,"Although Adelsberg was home to a medieval Jewish community, it was not until the early 17th century that the foundations of its modern Jewish community were established. During the first half of the 18th century, Jews lived on the grounds of a freeman’s castle, where they established a prayer hall and a synagogue, the latter of which was opened in 1775. Jews left the castle grounds in 1848, after which (in 1850 or between 1860 and 1862) they built another synagogue. The community maintained a mikveh and employed a schoolteacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. The dead were buried in Laudenbach. In 1933, three children studied religion in Adelsberg. By 1937, the community could no longer gather a minyan. Accordingly, Jewish men prayed with Jews from Hessdorf, alternating between synagogues. The annexation of Austria by the Third Reich in March 1938 sparked riots in Adelsberg, during which the windows in Jewish homes and in the synagogue were smashed. On Pogrom Night, SA men ravaged Jewish homes and destroyed the synagogue’s furniture. Luckily, most of the ritual items had been hidden in advance. Adelsberg’s remaining Jews left after the pogrom. Five emigrated and 10 relocated within Germany. At least 18 Adelsberg Jews perished in the Shoah.

A new synagogue (with a classroom and living quarters for the chazzan) was built in 1822 and renovated in 1852. Adelsdorf’s Jews used the regional cemetery near Zeckern, which was consecrated in either the 14th or 15th century. ￼In 1933, a teacher from Muehlhausen provided religious instruction for six children. On the morning before Pogrom Night (November 1938), SS men, aided by local Nazis and conscripts from a nearby labor camp, broke the windows and doors of Adeldorf ’s 12 Jewish homes, destroyed their furniture and burned ritual items from the synagogue in the market square. The school’s furniture was also destroyed, and several Jews were sent to Dachau. Following an assassination attempt against Hitler on November 9, 1939, Jews in Adelsdorf were attacked by individual aggressors. One Adelsdorf Jew was arrested for “defilement” of the “Aryan” race in February 1942. Two local Jews were deported to Izbica in April, 1942; nine “mixed race” Jews remained in Adelsdorf.

The community inaugurated a prayer room in 1773, a second prayer hall in 1844 (both were located in private residences), and a synagogue, on Altenbaustrasse, in 1894. Ahrweiler’s first Jewish cemetery was closed down in 1870, after which, in 1871, the community consecrated new burial grounds. In 1933, the 31 Jews of Ahrweiler ran a women’s association and a literary society. A teacher from Bad Neuenahr instructed schoolchildren in religion. On Pogrom Night, SA men smashed the synagogue’s windows, overturned its benches and hurled furnishings, ritual objects and books onto a bonfire. Jewish-owned stores were vandalized that night, and Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Eleven Ahrweiler Jews emigrated, seven relocated within Germany and 12 were deported to the East in 1942 (six in April, six in July).

The school—it had been officially recognized by the municipality in 1847—restricted its curriculum to religious studies in 1922, when enrollment there began to dwindle considerably. The Rosenberg family, which owned enamelware factories and traded in grain and textiles, was the most prominent Jewish family in Ahlen; its members chaired the community council until the Nazi period. In response to the deteriorating economic and political climate, many Jews left Ahlen after 1933: 17 reached Palestine and 17 North and South America.

Allenstein,1820,612 in 1925,448,"Jews founded a community in Allenstein in 1820, soon after which they established a prayer room on Richterstrasse. When the need for larger quarters became acute, the Jews of Allenstein acquired a plot of land on Liebstadter Strasse and built, in 1877, a large and ornate synagogue there. Other communal institutions included a cemetery on Seestrasse (present-day Grundwalzka Strasse) and a Jewish school. The Association of East Prussian Jewish Communities maintained a retirement home in Allenstein, as well as an office that aided Eastern European immigrants Allenstein was the birthplace of Erich Mendelsohn (1887- 1953), the world-famous Jewish architect whose unique buildings can be found all over Europe, in many North American cities and in Israel. In Allenstein, Mendelsohn designed the mourners’ chapel (called Mendelsohn Haus) next to the cemetery. The Jews of Allenstein were closely involved in the social and cultural life of the town, with many serving on the boards of prominent committees. This tranquil life began to unravel in the early 1920s, as anti-Semitic incidents escalated with every passing day. The situation worsened considerably after 1933: Boycotts were enforced zealously, several Jewish- owned department stores were firebombed, Nazi hoodlums roamed the streets and physically threatened Jews and, in early 1936, the Jewish cemetery was vandalized. On Pogrom Night, storm troopers destroyed Jewish establishments and burned down the synagogue, after which the site served as a bomb shelter; we also know that a number of Jews were arrested and deported that night. The pogrom triggered a mass emigration of local Jews from Germany, so that by 1939 only 135 Jews lived in the town. Those Jews who still lived in Allenstein in 1940 were deported to concentration camps. The Jewish cemetery and the Mendelsohn Haus survived the war. In 1960, however, the cemetery was leveled. Now an open, grassy area, the old cemetery site is the only remnant of Jewish Allenstein. A restoration project of the Mendelsohn Haus began in 2008.","Moshe Finkel; Sources: EJL, LJG www.ostpreussen.net",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=92,92

In 1933, only 35 Jews remained in Alpen, 17 of whom had left by Pogrom Night, when rioters set the synagogue on fire and wrecked Jewish homes. Nine Jews left Alpen soon after the pogrom, and we also know that 14 Alpen Jews managed to immigrate: six to Palestine, five to Brazil and three to South Africa.

A women’s association, two charitable societies and a branch of a Zionist organization were active in Alsbach in 1933. The synagogue’s interior and contents were destroyed on Pogrom Night; the cemetery was desecrated, and its tahara house blown up. Two Jewish homes, Alsbach’s last, were damaged and plundered, and Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald. Sold to a local resident for only 1,500 Reichsmarks, the synagogue was later used for storage. Alsbach was declared “free of Jews” in 1940. At least 11 Alsbach Jews, seven from Bickenbach, nine from Haehnlein and six from Jugenheim perished in the Shoah. The cemetery was restored after the war by order of a Jewish-American soldier whose forefathers were buried there.

The roots of the modern community emerged in the 17th century. Records suggest that the Alsfeld prayer room was established in the 18th century. A proper mikveh, built to replace three privately owned ritual baths, was opened in 1826. The community inaugurated a synagogue in a rented building on Metzgergasse in 1833; six years later it purchased the building. The synagogue housed a schoolroom and an apartment for a teacher who performed the duties of shochet and chazzan. The community established a cemetery in 1877, and, in 1905, a new synagogue on Lutherstrasse (350 seats). Local Jews were assaulted by Nazis on two occasions in 1931. In 1933, 220 Jews still lived in Alsfeld; 25 schoolchildren studied religion that year, and several religious and charitable associations were active. Under Nazi rule, Alsfeld Jews suffered many violent attacks, including cases of burglary, assault and destruction of property. Between 30 and 40 Jews left Alsfeld each year until 1939. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior was incinerated; the building’s exterior was also damaged. Jewish homes and businesses were attacked and property was destroyed. After the pogrom, the Nazis gave some remaining ritual objects to the local museum. The damaged synagogue was converted into a residence. Eighty-seven Jews emigrated; others relocated within Germany. In June 1939, the remaining 18 Jews were moved into a “Jew’s house.” All later left Alsfeld. At least 90 local Jews perished in the Shoah. Several ritual objects were later sent to Israel.

By the end of the 19th century, local Jews had consecrated a new cemetery (probably in 1873) and built a mikveh. A teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet was responsible for the religious education of Jewish children. The village’s peak Jewish population in 1873 included Jews from nearby Ebernburg and Feilbingert. In 1933, the community counted 39 members, six of whom lived in Altenbamberg, 14 in Ebernburg and 19 in Hochstaetten. One Jewish child received religious instruction that year. On Pogrom Night, Altenbamberg’s synagogue was set on fire; the blaze consumed all but the outer walls. We also know that the cemetery was desecrated in 1939. Many Altenbamberg Jews emigrated during the 1930s. Those who remained after the pogrom were, in October 1940, deported to Gurs.

In 1828, by which pointthe site was no longer able to accommodate the growing congregation, a larger building—it housed a synagogue, a school and an apartment for a teacher—was purchased. The community abandoned this synagogue in 1914 and acquired yet another building. We also know that the school functioned for only part of the year; Jewish children attended Christian schools at all other times. Jewish-owned stores and businesses were attacked and plundered on Pogrom Night; a truck rammed into and shattered all the display windows of the Heinemann department store. The synagogue building was stormed by uniformed members of the Nazi Party and SA, who demolished, burned or confiscated the furnishings. The building itself, however, was not set on fire, and would later house the town’s remaining Jews, pending their deportation.

During the years of the Weimar Republic, Jews took an active part in the economic, social and cultural life of the town in spite of sporadic anti-Semitic outbursts.

Altenburg (Thuringia),14th century,165 in 1925,130,"According to records, Altenburg was home to a synagogue and a Judengasse during the 14th century, proving that an organized community existed there. The community was annihilated in the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, and we also know that the local aristocracy prohibited Jews from settling in the area from 1540 until 1800, so that it was only in the 19th century that a lasting Jewish community was established in Altenburg. Burials were conducted in Leipzig, the nearest large community, until the early 1920s, when a section of the municipal cemetery was allocated for Jewish use. An influx of Jewish immigrants, mainly from Galicia, arrived in Altenburg during the same decade; in 1925, they founded their own community and set up a synagogue in a rented hall on Pauritzerstrasse. In 1938, a few weeks before Pogrom Night, members of this Polish community were deported to the Polish-German border and abandoned there. On the night of November 10, 1938, the day after Pogrom Night, the remaining Jewish houses were raided; the inhabitants assaulted and forced to stand in the street in their nightclothes. The synagogue was destroyed, and the men were deported to Buchenwald. The 80 or so Jews who still lived in Altenburg in September of 1939 were moved into several “Jews’ houses,” subjected to forced labor and deported in 1942/43. Very few of these deportees survived the war. In 1944, two concentration camps, incarcerating approximately 2,000 Hungarian and Polish Jews who had been sent there as slave laborers, were set up inAltenburg; 99 inmates were buried in the cemetery. In 2002, a memorial plaque listing their names and dates of death was unveiled there. Eleven Jews, apparently survivors of these camps, lived in Altenburg after the war.

At least 44 Angenrod Jews and two from Leusel (an affiliated community) perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue was demolished in 1962, after which a garden was planted on the site.

Angermuende,13th century,135 in 1880,60,"Prior to 1815, when Angermuende’s Jewish community established a synagogue in a barn on 56 Klosterstrasse (present-day 10 Klosterstrasse), religious gatherings took place in merchant Abraham Jonas’ home on 65 Rosenstrasse. The synagogue was enlarged in 1865 and crowned with a dome, but it was, ironically, around this time that many Jews from Angermuende decided to leave for larger cities. In or around 1743, the community engaged a teacher of religion. Angermuende’s Jewish cemetery was opened after an outbreak of an epidemic in 1709 made it unsafe to transport the dead to Shweedt or Odenburg. The community mikveh was located at 1 Bruederstrasse until the building was deemed unsafe in 1910. Jews were exposed to relentless humiliation and extortion after 1933. On Pogrom Night, Jewish homes were wrecked, furniture was thrown out of windows and the synagogue was burned to the ground. The cemetery was also desecrated, its tombstones stolen. Forty-one Angermuende Jews perished in the Shoah. As of this writing, a memorial plaque to the former Jewish community has never been unveiled in Angermuende.","Ruth Martina Trucks; Sources EJL, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=111,111
Annaberg,1839,147 in 1907,58,"Beginning in 1554, Jews were forbidden from settling in the Ore Mountains region near Annaberg. In or around 1811, Jewish merchants started to attend the local fairs, but it was only after 1867 that Jews were permitted to settle permanently in Annaberg. A Liberal Jewish community, founded in 1890, conducted services at 3 Schulberg and (starting in 1925) at 17 Buchholzer Strasse. Annaberg’s Jewish cemetery, located on Chemnitzer Strasse, was consecrated in 1902. From the 1850s until the beginning of the 20th century, local Jews owned important trimmings factories, but the demand for these products diminished after WWI, forcing many Jews to leave. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the prayer room, vandalized Jewish-owned shops and homes, blew up the cemetery hall and desecrated the cemetery itself; several local Jewish men were arrested that night. The cemetery was leveled in 1940, after which some of the corpses were exhumed and transferred to the Chemnitz Jewish cemetery. The remains of the prayer room were torn down in 1945. Three Annaberg Jews were among the last Jews to be deported from Saxony on February 15, 1945. At least 14 Annaberg Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1957, a “Jewish Memorial Grove” was established at the Annaberg-Buchholz cemetery. Later, in 1988, a memorial stone was unveiled there.","Beate Grosz-Wenker; Sources: AJ, EJ, JAE, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=114,114
Anklam,mid-1300s,311 in 1861,43,"Jews lived in Anklam from the mid-1300s until the Black Death pogroms, when they were burned at the stake. In 1712, at which point Anklam was under Swedish rule, the authorities issued a ban on Jewish settlement. All bans were annulled in 1812, after which Jews began to return to Anklam. By 1817, a Jewish community had been founded, complete with a prayer room, a cemetery and a school. In order to accommodate the growing community, a synagogue was built and inaugurated in 1841. As a token of gratitude to the local count who granted permission to build the synagogue, the community mounted his portrait on the wall of the synagogue’s foyer. Anti-Semitism became a real problem for Anklam Jews in early 1933 and by 1935 the situation was almost intolerable. Although the synagogue was set on fire on Pogrom Night, it did not burn down completely, and was subsequently used for grain storage. A small plaque was later unveiled at the synagogue site.","Moshe Finkel; Sources: EJL, LJG, SIA, WDJMV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=113,113
Anroechte,1667,80 in 1864,53,"It was not until 1667 that the first Jew settled in Anroechte. Other Jewish families moved there in or around 1700, but the records do not reveal much about the 17th-century community. We do know, however, that Anroechte’s Jewish population figures for 1849 and 1864 were 49 and 80, respectively. Burials were conducted at the cemetery on Pohlgartenstrasse, which was consecrated at some point before 1800. We also know that the community conducted services in a prayer room on Teichstrasse, and that the building’s annex (built in the late 1850s) housed a Jewish school until 1939. In 1933, 53 Jews lived in Anroechte; seven schoolchildren received religious instruction. In the spring of 1938, SA men damaged the synagogue on three occasions. It is likely that the mayor of Anroechte, who had since 1934 striven to make his village Judenfrei (free of Jews), condoned the violence. On Pogrom Night, non-local members of the SA and SS vandalized the synagogue and set its furniture and ritual objects on fire; the Torah scrolls, however, had been removed from the building beforehand. In Anroechte, Jewish homes and shops were damaged. Twenty-six local Jews managed to emigrate. The remaining Jews were moved to a Judenhaus and subjected to forced labor. According to the records, 39 local Jews were deported to Zamość and Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 41 Anroechte Jews perished in the Shoah. Three Jewish survivors returned to Anroechte after the war. At the synagogue site, now a playground, a commemorative stone was unveiled in 1985.

Anrath,17th century,116 in 1852,unknown (40 in 1930),"Although Jews lived in Anrath as early as the mid-17th century, it was only about a century later that an organized Jewish community began to emerge there. Most local Jews earned their livings through the cattle and retail trades. In 1804, the community replaced its 18th-century prayer room (most likely built at the end of the century) with a small synagogue, in the basement of which was a mikveh. Later, a school and living quarters for the teacher were established in the building’s annex. The Jews of Anrath built a new synagogue in 1878. We also know that the Jewish cemetery—it was located in a forest near Anrath—was consecrated before 1800. The municipality expropriated the cemetery site during the Nazi period, using many of the tombstones as building material. Although the synagogue had ceased to function as a place of worship after 1937 (or so the records suggest), its windows were smashed on Pogrom Night. In 1939/40, Polish POWs were housed there. Used as a warehouse after the war, thebuilding was later converted into a residence and was used as such until the structure was demolished in 1960. Few Jews lived in Anrath during the Nazi period as community membership had declined steadily after 1852. The Nazis deported 13 local Jews, all of whom perished.","Moshe Aumann; Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=115,115
Archshofen,1696,180 in 1870,23,"Records from 1696 mention a Jewish presence in Archshofen, but it was only in 1828 that a community, made up largely of middle-class merchants, was established there. A prayer room had existed in the home of one “Simson the Jew” during the early 18th century. In 1741, the congregation moved to a new prayer hall, which was also located in a private residence. Finally, in 1796/97, the community inaugurated a synagogue: A mikveh was installed there in 1821, and we also know that the house of worship was enlarged and renovated in 1865. Archshofen was home to a Jewish elementary school between 1829 and 1910, after which a teacher instructed children in religion. Burials were conducted in Creglingen. In 1933, only 23 Jews lived in Archshofen. The synagogue, closed in the mid-1930s because there were not enough men to make up a minyan, was sold to the village council.Nevertheless, members of the Hitler Youth broke its windows and chandeliers on Pogrom Night. Twelve local Jews managed to emigrate, one relocated within Germany and five died in Archshofen. Five Jews, Archshofen’s last, were deported to Riga (December 1941) and to Theresienstadt (August 1942). At least 26 Archshofen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Jews, expelled from the town in 1560, resettled there in 1609. Ansbach’s Jewish population peaked at 450 in 1837. The community of the 15th century maintained a synagogue.

Arnsberg,14th century,134 in 1885,40,"Although it is likely that individual Jews settled in Arnsberg as early as the mid-14th century, it was not until 1600 that a Jewish presence was recorded there, and not until 1810 that the community began to grow. It was in 1810, too, that Jews were granted residency rights, albeit for a fee. Local Jews, many of whom were cattle dealers and butchers, had, by the second half of the 19th century, joined the upper middle class. As such, they contributed greatly to the town’s economic life. The Jews of Arnsberg used the facilities of a neighboring community until 1824/25, when they established a synagogue, a school and a cemetery. A new Jewish school was inaugurated in 1853, and we also know that Jewish schoolteachers—between 1825 and 1875, 16 teachers held this post—performed the duties of cantor, mohel, undertaker, etc. Other communal institutions included a cemetery; consecrated in 1847 and initially owned by a small group of businessmen, the cemetery became community property in 1886, as did the synagogue. Many Jews left Arnsberg at the turn of the 20th century, so that the Jewish population of 1926 and 1933 was 90 and 40, respectively. By 1938, most Jewish shops had been “Aryanized.” On Pogrom Night, SA troops and a mob of local residents desecrated the cemetery and destroyed Jewish homes. Although the rioters broke into the synagogue and desecrated the ritual objects, they were, or so reports suggest, prevented from burning down the building by neighboring residents who feared that the blaze would spread to their own homes. Most of the remaining Jewish men were sent to Sachsenhausen and held there for several weeks. Seventeen local Jews left for other German cities. Of those who emigrated, seven reached the Netherlands, six South America and five Palestine. At least 37 Arnsberg Jews perished in the Shoah.

These included a cemetery (1870), a Jewish school, a synagogue and a mikveh. The sites for these institutions were acquired in the 18th century, and rebuilt in the rustic style of the period during the ensuing decades. On Pogrom Night, Argenschwang’s synagogue and remaining Jewish-owned business and homes were broken into and damaged heavily. Those Jews who could not escape were deported during the war years. The synagogue’s exterior, today a protected site, was saved from destruction, possibly through the intervention of a Gentile villager.

We also know that a later community, established by 50 Jews in 1430, was expelled from Arnstadt. The town’s modern Jewish community, made up largely of cattle and textile dealers, was founded in 1880. Services were conducted in the home of Julius Jonas until the establishment of a prayer hall later that year; and in 1913, the hall was replaced by a proper synagogue. Burials were conducted in conjunction with the nearby Plau community until some point during World War One, when local Jews were allotted a section of the Arnstadt cemetery. The synagogue was vandalized and burned down on Pogrom Night; the ruins were later leveled at the congregation’s expense. Jewish dwellings were looted during the pogrom, and those businesses that had survived the 1933 boycott were forcibly “Aryanized”; their owners arrested and held in the municipality cellar. By 1940, at least 60 Jews had emigrated. The remaining 50 were confined to houses from which they were deported to the East. Twelve local Jews survived the Shoah.

The community maintained an elementary school—it was located inside the synagogue building—between 1800 and 1847, after which a teacher/ chazzan instructed Jewish children in religion. The Jews of Arheiligen employed a shochet, maintained a mikveh and, for a brief period in the early 19th century, ran a cemetery. As the cemetery was located near a site for cattle burial, the community eventually shut it down and began using the Jewish burial grounds in Gross-Gerau. After World War I, services were no longer conducted regularly in the synagogue. The building was sold in the spring of 1938. On Pogrom Night, Jewish homes and businesses were stormed and plundered. Dora Stern, wounded by a heavy stone thrown into her house, died in the hospital; Johanna Reinhardt jumped from a window when the Nazis broke into her house, after which she, too, died. Reinhardt’s father committed suicide a few weeks later. All Jews left Arheiligen, mostly for Darmstadt; two immigrated to Palestine. At least 10 Arheiligen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Aschaffenburg,14th century (see below),unknown,591,"According to the available records, Aschaffenburg’s 14th- century Jewish community maintained its own synagogue. The community was nearly annihilated during the Armleder massacres (1336-39) and the Black Death pogroms (1348/49). In 1696, in response to an increase in the number of Jews moving to Aschaffenburg, a new synagogue was built on Dalbergstrasse/Rathausgasse. It was not until 1893 that the community established a more spacious synagogue (on Entengasse). In the 19th century, Aschaffenburg became the seat of a district rabbinate. The rabbinate’s building, adjacent to the synagogue, housed a school, a mikveh, an apartment for the rabbi and a hostel for the poor. We also know that, between 1735 and 1890, burials were conducted in the Am Erbig cemetery near Schweinheim. In 1890, the community consecrated a cemetery next to the churchyard in the old part of town. Six hundred and seventy Jews lived in Aschaffenburg in 1910, by which point several Jewish organizations were active in the community: charities, a chevra kadisha, Zionist groups, a branch of the Central Union, etc. Raphael Breuer served as rabbi between 1909 and 1932, as did Fritz Bloch between 1932 and 1938. In 1933, the community numbered 591 members. Later, in 1938, teacher Leo Schloss celebrated 25 years of service to the community. On Pogrom Night, plainclothes SA men burned down the synagogue, damaged Jewish homes and shops and shot two Jews, one fatally. Twenty Jews were arrested on Pogrom Night, as were six others on November 12; most were eventually released. In 1942, approximately 188 local Jews were deported to Izbica and to Theresienstadt.

Arnswalde,14th century,unknown,118,"The earliest available record of a Jewish community in Arnswalde is dated 1321. Records from the 16th and 17th centuries offer scant information about the few Jews who lived in Arnswalde during this period. The modern community came into being at the beginning of the 18th century. Local Jews consecrated a cemetery and a synagogue, the latter of which, located on 7 Judenstrasse, had 208 members in 1880. We also know that Rabbi Abraham Altmann served the community from 1886 until 1933, and that teacher Abraham Berliner, who later became a leading Orthodox scholar, was employed there between 1859 and 1865. Anti-Jewish riots erupted in Arnswalde in the 1890s, when Jewish-owned shops were demolished. Blood libel accusations were made in 1895, resulting in assaults against Jews and the desecration of the Jewish cemetery. In 1933, 118 Jews lived in Arnswalde, served by a chazzan who also performed the duties of shochet. Active in the community were a chevra kadisha and the Israel Women’s Association, the latter of which was founded in 1884 to aid the poor. In February 1934, rioters threw rocks and fired shots at and into Jewish homes; SA troops damaged the synagogue’s interior and its Torah scrolls. Most Jews left Arnswalde after the violence.

By then, the 15 Jews of Bruchenbruecken and nine of Boenstadt had been affiliated with the community. Although synagogue services were discontinued in 1936, the building was nevertheless damaged on Pogrom Night. A Jewish home was attacked, and an elderly Jew lost an eye after being struck in the face with an axe. Most Jews left Assenheim; in 1940, some managed to immigrate to Santo Domingo. Of the five Jews who still lived in Assenheim in 1942, four were deported to Poland in September of that year; the fifth, married to a Christian, remained in the town.

Aschersleben,early 14th century,145 in 1864,77,"The Jews of 14th-century Aschersleben, most of whom were small business owners and moneylenders, lived in the Juedendorf (Jews’ village) outside the city walls. Banished from Aschersleben by the bishop of Halberstadt in 1495, Jews did not return to the town until 1767, when two Jewish families settled there. Residence restrictions were eased during the period of Westphalian rule. Beginning in 1831, the community maintained a prayer room and a mikveh. In 1852, a synagogue was inaugurated in the backyard of a house at 12 Juedendorf, next to which were rooms for classes in religion and apartments for the community’s teacher and chazzan. A rabbi served the community between 1884 and 1895. Aschersleben was home to two Jewish cemeteries: the first, established on an unspecified date, was located on the corner of Johannisplatz and Geschwister-Scholl-Strasse; the second, dedicated in 1872, was located on 35 Schmidtmann Strasse. Many Aschersleben Jews were successful professionals, and we also know that several textile shops and two banks were owned by local Jews. With the rise of Nazism, many Jews left Aschersleben. The community was dissolved in 1935, but rioters nevertheless destroyed the synagogue and the cemetery hall on Pogrom Night; several elderly Jews were deported to Theresienstadt. At least 25 Aschersleben Jews perished in the Shoah. Aschersleben was home to a forced labor camp for Jewish women between December of 1940 and 1943; records suggest that approximately 70 Austrian prisoners were deported to Auschwitz from this camp. In January 1944, a satellite camp of Buchenwald was established in Aschersleben. From there approximately 450 men and 500 (mostly Jewish) women—they had been brought there to assemble aircraft fuselages—were, in April of 1945, sent on a death march to Torgau.

Augsburg,1212,1217 in 1910,,"According to legend, Jews lived in Augsburg during Christ’s lifetime, but the first available record of a Jewish presence there—it mentions one Joseph de Augusta—is dated 1212. Town records from 1242 mention a rabbi (Rabbi Baruch) and a Jewish cemetery, proof that a community existed there at the time, making Augsburg the oldest Jewish community in Swabia. Local residents protected the Jews from the Rindfleisch (1298) and Armleder (1336) pogroms, but turned on them during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, during which nearly all local Jews were massacred. The community was reestablished quickly, but in 1438 the 300 Jews of Augsburg were expelled from the town, their cemetery was confiscated and the synagogue converted into a residential building. After that, few Jews settled in Augsburg, although several prominent individuals managed to establish a presence there, among them Rabbi Yaakov ben Yehuda Weil (15th century), who established a yeshiva, and Hayyim Schwarz (16th century), who established a Hebrew press. In 1803, Jews settled in Augsburg in larger numbers, and in 1861 the town became the seat of the district rabbinate. Local Jews conducted services in prayer rooms—namely, in the house of Jakob Obermayer at 2 Johannisgasse; on High Holidays, services were conducted at Schiessgrabensaal— until 1861, when they established a small synagogue at 11 Wintergasse, the first Bavarian synagogue to feature an organ. On April 4, 1917, Rabbi Richard Gruenfeld inaugurated a new synagogue at 6-8 Halderstrasse; architect Fritz Landauer designed the building, and it was, with its copper dome, one of the most impressive synagogues in Germany. Beginning in 1867, burials were conducted at the Hochfeld cemetery (64 Haunstetter Strasse). By 1933, the community enjoyed an array of Jewish organizations and economic opportunities, especially in the banking sector. Dr. Ernst Jacob—he later immigrated to the United States—was rabbi, and 149 children attended the Jewish school. With the Nazis in power, the synagogue became more and more of a sanctuary for the Jewish community, including the children who received both religious and secular instruction from instructor Fritz Levy. Jewish businesses were “Aryanized” during those years, so that by 1939 not a single Jewish establishment did business in Augsburg. Between 1933 and 1941, 450 Jews left the town. On Pogrom Night, Jewish stores were looted and the synagogue was vandalized; the latter was set on fire, but the fire department extinguished it in order to protect the surrounding buildings. All Jewish men under the age of 70 were sent to Dachau on Pogrom Night. Beginning in 1941, the remaining 400 Jews were deported to Riga, Piaski and Theresienstadt, with the deportations continuing into 1945. After the war, 25 Jews returned to Augsburg.

Attendorn,16th century,46 in 1900,,"Several Jews lived in Attendorn in the second half of the 16th century. Beginning in 1840, the tiny community conducted services in a prayer room (located in a residential building). Burials took place in a cemetery shared with the Jewish community of neighboring Olpe. Among the more prominent Jewish-owned businesses in the town was A.A. Ursell Metal Works. In early 1937, a sign, erected at the entrance of the town, warned that, “Jews who set foot in this town do so at their own risk.” After an unidentified resident removed the sign, the Nazi newspaper Der Stuermer denounced Attendorn as a “Jew-friendly” town. On Pogrom Night, dozens of SS and SA men, accompanied by local children acting under the direction of their teacher, attacked and damaged the synagogue, Jewish homes and Jewish-owned businesses. The synagogue building was torn down in the mid-1980s, several years after which a memorial plaque was unveiled at the site.","Moshe Aumann; Sources: LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=129,129
Aub,13th century,115 in 1890,73,"The earliest accounts of Jewish residents in Aub refer to the anti-Semitic Rindfleisch massacres of 1298 and the Armleder persecutions of 1336. Jews later resettled in the village, and the community peaked at 115 in 1890. A rabbinate was based in Aub from the 16th until the late 19th century. The village’s first synagogue, established in or around 1600, was replaced in 1744/45 by a new building on Neuertgasse. The community maintained a school, a mikveh and a cemetery at Harbachweg, the last of which was consecrated in 1630. In 1933, the teacher/chazzan instructed six schoolchildren in religion. A chevra kadisha and a Talmud Torah foundation were active in Aub that year. On Pogrom Night, SA and SS troops destroyed the synagogue’s interior and looted homes and businesses. Jewish men, women and children were detained in Aub’s court building, where the men were beaten. Seven Jews were imprisoned in Ochsenfurt. Twenty-one Aub Jews emigrated during the Nazi period and 55 moved elsewhere in Germany. The community was dissolved when the last Jews left in 1940. At least 47 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was later converted into apartments. A memorial stone has been unveiled at the old cemetery.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn; Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-BAV, SIA, WSRU",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=130,130
Augsburg-Kriegshaber,14th century,415 in 1737,40-50,"The Jewish community of Kriegshaber consecrated a cemetery in 1627. It was during the 17th century, too, that the community employed a rabbi and opened a prayer hall. The Kriegshaber synagogue was established in a house on Ulmerstrasse at some point between 1680 and 1685. Rebuilt in 1725 and transferred to the community in 1791, the synagogue was renovated several times between 1730 and 1913. The mikveh, located in a private home, became community property in 1840. In Kriegshaber, teachers of religion also functioned as cantors and ritual slaughterers. We also know that the community had been affiliated with that of Augsburg by 1916. The synagogue escaped serious damage on Pogrom Night (one window was smashed). Between December of 1938 and 1942, local Jews continued to conduct services in the Kriegshaber synagogue. Most Kriegshaber Jews emigrated; those who remained were deported in 1942. In 1944, 500 Hungarian-Jewish women were brought to the town from Auschwitz to work in armament production. At least 16 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1945, the synagogue housed a vocational school for potential immigrants to Palestine. The Augsburg municipality acquired the building in 1955 and used it, among other things, as a church and a storage depot. A memorial was later unveiled at the cemetery.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn; Sources: AJ, EJL, KBO, PK-BAV , jhva.wordpress.com/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=132,132
Aurich,1635,406 in 1885,398,"In 1810, the Jews of Aurich established a synagogue at 13 Kirchstrasse (renovated in 1911). The community also maintained a school (with an apartment for the teacher) and a mikveh, the latter of which was located in the synagogue building. Burials were conducted in neighboring Norden until 1764, when a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Aurich. This Orthodox Jewish community was served by its own rabbi until 1826; later, between 1841 and 1846, Samson Raphael Hirsch served as the provincial rabbi for Aurich. Although a local Jew was elected to the town council in 1913 (one had also been elected in 1848), in that same year attempts were made, for the first time, to forbid Jewish ritual slaughter. In 1933, 398 Jews lived in Aurich, with which the smaller communities of Grosefehn, Sandhorst and Kirchdorf were affiliated. Anti-Semitism intensified in the town in 1930, and the mayor, who had defended Jewish residents from propaganda being spread by the Protestant pastor and local Nazis, was forced out of office in 1933. Although many Jews had sold their properties by 1935, 54 students were registered at the school in 1937. On Pogrom Night, SA men set the synagogue on fire and seized other Jewish properties. After abusing Jewish men in a local hall, the SA sent between 40 and 50 of their victims to perform forced labor in Ellernfeld, after which they were imprisoned in Aurich before being sent to Sachsenhausen, where they were interned for several weeks. Only 17 children attended the Jewish school after the pogrom. In early 1940, in response to the likelihood of evacuation, most of the remaining 155 Jews fled Aurich; the last 20 left in March 1940. Approximately 150 Aurich Jews emigrated from Germany, but many of those who had fled to the Netherlands were later deported to the extermination camps. According to the records, 200 Aurich Jews perished in the Shoah. Today, a memorial stone (at “Auf dem hohen Wall”) together with a model of the former synagogue commemorates the destroyed house of worship; another plaque commemorates the site of the former Jewish school.","Esther Sarah Evans; Sources: EJL, JGNB1",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=134,134
Aumund-Vegesack,18th century,150 in 1921,approximately 110,"Most Aumund Jews were traders, peddlers, butchers and domestic servants. The Jewish community, which also served Jews from neighboring Vegesack and Lesum, erected a synagogue on Kirchstrasse (50 seats for men, 50 for women) in the 1850s. Eighty-one Jews lived in Aumund in the mid-19th century. Burials were conducted presumably in Schwanewede, but the community was able to maintain its own mikveh and school, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Later, in the early 1900s, the Jews of Aumund established a chevra kadisha, a branch of the Centralverein and a Jewish youth movement. In 1933, approximately 110 Jews lived in Aumund, many of whom left during the subsequent years as a result of economic and social isolation. The community was dissolved in April 1938. On Pogrom Night, Jewish property was vandalized and a number of Jews were arrested; records suggest that the men were deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. SA men from Bremen set the synagogue on fire, after which the building burned down completely. In 1939, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into designated houses in Bremen. Together with other Jews from the region, most were deported in 1941 and 1942. Between 38 and 53 Jews from Aumund died in the Shoah.

Babenhausen,1318,100 in 1871,57,"Records from 1357 and from the 15th century mention a Judenschule (Jews’ school), which possibly refers to a synagogue. The community apparently established a new synagogue on 16 Amtsgasse—with an adjacent school and teacher’s apartment—in the 17th century; a mikveh in or around 1827; and, finally, yet another new synagogue, built on the older synagogue’s site, in the 19th century. Burials took place in Frankfurt am Main until 1570, when the Jews of Babenhausen consecrated a cemetery on Potsdamer Strasse. A teacher of religion, who also performed the duties of shochet and chazzan, was active in Babenhausen. The community was disbanded in October 1938, around which time the synagogue was sold. The building’s interior and furniture were nevertheless destroyed on Pogrom Night, as was Jewish property. That night, a woman and her son were beaten severely; Jewish men were detained in the municipality building, from which two were sent to Buchenwald. Sixteen Jews emigrated, 32 relocated within Germany and four, the last, were deported. At least 30 Babenhausen Jews and 11 from the affiliated communities of Langstadt and Kleestadt perished in the Shoah. After World War II, several Jews returned to Babenhausen. The upper floor of the synagogue was demolished in 1953; at the time of this writing, the ground floor served as a painter’s shop.

Bad Bentheim,14th century,81 in 1885,24,"The Jewish community of Bad Bentheim emerged in the 17th century. By 1881, most members were merchants and butchers. Jewish cemeteries were consecrated in Bad Bentheim in 1694 and 1874 (on In den Bergkaempen and Hilgenstiege, respectively). The community established a synagogue on Synagogenstiege/Willhelmstrasse in 1853 and a school in 1864, the latter of which moved to new buildings in 1874 and 1912 and closed in 1922. Bad Bentheim Jews were active in local politics and social life, serving on the board of the sports club, the teachers’ association and the organization of poultry farmers. A branch of the Jewish Benevolent Society (an organization that aided Jewish migrants from Poland) was established in Bad Bentheim at some point in the 1920s. In 1933, 24 Jews lived in Bentheim, of whom at least 11 left before 1938. Later, on Pogrom Night, Jewish men were arrested, Jewish properties were vandalized and the synagogue’s interior was demolished; ritual objects were left on the street, but a neighboring resident saved them from destruction. The municipality confiscated the synagogue, after which, in 1939, the building was sold. Twelve local Jews left (most fled to the Netherlands) after Pogrom Night; the town’s last two Jews left in 1942. At least 17 Bad Bentheim Jews died in the Shoah. During the 1960s, the synagogue site accommodated a commercial building.

Bad Bergzabern,14th century,123 in 1880,unknown (43 in 1932),"Few or no Jews lived in Bad Bergzabern in the 15th century, for it was then that the authorities prohibited Jewish settlement in the province of Zweibruecken. By 1623, however, a new Jewish presence had been recorded there. The community established a prayer room in, at the latest, 1815. Although a Jewish elementary school was opened in Bad Bergzabern in 1837, it was closed in 1915 as a result of low enrollment numbers. We also know that, between 1848 and 1850, the Jews of Bad Bergzabern established a proper synagogue which accommodated a mikveh and a school; originally built by Duke Gustav Samuel as a residence for Capuchin monks, the building was located to the east of the market church, below the pharmacy. The synagogue had a seating capacity of 190 (120 men on the main floor, 70 women in the balcony) and 10 Torah scrolls. Bad Bergzabern and the affiliated community of Pleisweiler belonged to the district rabbinate in Landau. In1932,whenonly43JewslivedinBergzabern,Raphael Mandel, the teacher, instructed three students in religion. By 1938 the Jewish population had dwindled to 22; and in May 1939, only 17 Jews remained in Bergzabern. Nineteen local Jews emigrated during the Nazi period, and many others relocated to other towns and cities in Germany. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA men smashed the synagogue’s windows, destroyed the interior, tore off part of the roof and confiscated the Torah scrolls and ritual objects. Several days later, the building was demolished, not long after which (in 1939) the property was sold to the municipality for 830 Reichsmarks. In October 1940, the remaining four Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least 16 Bad Bergzabern Jews perished in concentration camps during the Shoah.

Bad Berleburg,17th century,119 in 1843,39,"In 1800, the Jewish community of Bad Berleburg replaced its small synagogue (built, at the latest, in 1730) with a larger house of worship. Located in the downtown district, the building also accommodated a school and living quarters for the teacher. This synagogue was destroyed in the fire of 1825, after which, in the mid-1830s, local Jews dedicated a new synagogue. Burials were conducted in neighboring cemeteries until the 1740s, when the community consecrated its own burial grounds. Beginning in 1905, however, local Jews buried their dead in the municipal cemetery. Jews were well-integrated into the economy until the beginning of the Nazi era, and even then many residents continued to patronize Jewish stores despite the Nazi boycott. Anti-Jewish restrictions and regulations, however, triggered a wave of Jewish emigration. On Pogrom Night, more than 100 members of various Nazi organizations broke into the synagogue and shattered its windows, after which (this was done in the marketplace) theysetthefurnitureandritualobjectsonfire.Transferredto new owners in 1939, the synagogue building was eventually converted into an apartment building. Local Jewish men were sent to the Oranienburg concentration camp after Pogrom Night, and the remaining Jews were later deported. Between 1934 and 1942, 13 Berleburg Jews relocated to other towns and cities in Germany. At least 10 Berleburg Jews immigrated, six of them to the United States. On April 28, 1942, three Jews were deported to the East; and on July 27 the last 15 were sent to Theresienstadt. According to all but one source, none returned.

Bad Brueckenau,16th century,124 in 1910,117,"Although Jews were expelled from Brueckenau in 1671, a community was established there in the 18th century, members of which opened a synagogue, a Talmud Torah and a mikveh. The synagogue and school burned down in 1876, and it was not until 1913 that a new house of worship was inaugurated in Brueckenau. Brueckenau’s Jewish cemetery, the last to be opened in Bavaria, was consecrated in 1923. The local spa resort, called Bad Brueckenau, offered three kosher hotels; guests could congregate in the Kaufmann Hotel’s prayer room. In 1933, a chevra kadisha was still active in Brueckenau. The Nazis banned religious services at the Kaufmann Hotel in 1936. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA and SS men burned down the synagogue and school, damaged the nearby school building and wrecked the Jewish hotels. All but a few elderly men were deported to Dachau. Twenty-nine Jews from Brueckenau and nearby Vernarz emigrated, 95 relocated within Germany and seven, the last, were deported to Izbica and to Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 37 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1897, a memorial monument was unveiled at the cemetery.

Bad Buchau,1382,828 in 1858,162,"The oldest record of a Jewish presence in Bad Buchau is dated 1382. The Jewish population peaked at 828 in 1858, making Bad Buchau’s community the largest in Wuerttemberg at that time. Local Jews established several prayer rooms in the 15th century, an official community in the 16th century, and their first synagogue in 1731. The community’s status subsequently grew, as a result of which the town hosted a regional rabbinate in the 18th century. A new synagogue, the only one in Germany to feature a bell tower, was inaugurated in 1839; the house of worship contained a mikveh and a small Jewish museum, the latter during the 1920s. The community also maintained a Jewish school and a cemetery. Albert Einstein’s father was born in Bad Buchau in 1847. In 1933, 162 Jews lived in Bad Buchau. Several associations were active there, and six pupils still attended the Jewish school. The community’s last rabbi was Abraham Schlesinger, one of Germany’s few Zionist rabbis. Although the synagogue was set on fire on Pogrom Night, the fire brigade and several local residents, including the mayor, extinguished the blaze. Jewish homes and businesses were nonetheless vandalized, and 12 men were sent to Dachau. The synagogue was set on fire the following day, burning down completely; the ruins were later demolished. In 1942, 44 Jews were sent to Bad Buchau. They were among the 111 Jews deported from the town to the East in 1941 and 1942. At least 56 Bad Buchau Jews died in the Shoah.

Bad Cannstatt,1471,484 in 1900,261,"Few Jews lived in Bad Cannstatt during the Middle Ages, but records from 1471 mention a Jewish presence there. Jews settled in the area again in 1826, after which their numbers grew steadily. A Jewish community was founded in 1871, and although Bad Cannstatt was incorporated into Stuttgart in 1905, the community remained independent until 1936 (at which point it became an affiliate of the Jewish community in Stuttgart). The Jews of Cannstatt opened a prayer hall in 1867 (they had used a private home for this purpose during the preceding seven years). In 1876, a synagogue with seating capacity for 85 persons was inaugurated at 49 Koenigstrasse (present- day Koenig-Karl-Strasse). Renovated on several occasions, the last of which was as late as 1938, this Liberal synagogue housed an organ. In 1910, Cannstatt’s Orthodox Jews set up a prayer room in a private residence at 84 Koenigstrasse. The community began, in 1880, to offer classes in religion at 7 Brunnenstrasse; the teacher also functioned as chazzan and shochet. A cemetery was consecrated in 1872 and enlarged in 1915 and 1929. In 1933, 261 Jews lived in Bad Cannstatt: twenty- four children received religious instruction, and the town was home to several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide Jewish organizations. The Jewish communities of Backnang, Nuertingen and Waiblingen were affiliates of Bad Cannstatt. The synagogue was completely burned down on Pogrom Night. Windows in a Jewish-owned business were broken, and Jewish men were sent to the Welzheim and Dachau camps. The synagogue ruins were cleared at the Jewish community’s expense. Most Bad Cannstatt Jews managed to emigrate. Eighteen local Jews were deported to the East and to Theresienstadt between 1941 and 1943, and at least 57 perished in the Shoah.

Bad Driburg,17th century,71 in 1888,,"Although Jews established a presence in Driburg in the 17th century, the town authorities were, from the outset, determined to limit the growth of any official Jewish community. It was only at the start of the 19th century, in fact, that the community experienced moderate growth, with approximately 50 members, making up 2% of the town’s total population. The Jewish community of Bad Driburg was officially founded in the mid-19th century. Local Jews conducted services in a private residence and at the synagogue of a neighboring community until 1828, when a synagogue was inaugurated in Driburg. This house of worship was destroyed in a neighborhood fire in 1876, soon after which, in 1878, the community established a new synagogue with a seating capacity of 100 (40 in the women’s section). In Driburg, a cemetery was consecrated in 1820; the oldest tombstone is dated 1823, and the last burial took place there in 1940. According to records, Driburg was home to a Jewish elementary school between 1852 and 1855, and again between 1906 and 1914. On Pogrom Night, rioters demolished the synagogue and set its contents on fire; Jewish homes and stores were vandalized, and a number of men were sent to Buchenwald. Eleven Jews (out of a total of 42) managed to emigrate before 1940; most of those who stayed behind were deported to Eastern Europe, and we also know that 26 perished in the Shoah.

It was not until the 17th century that a new Jewish presence was established there. The synagogue on the corner of Wachenheimer Strasse and Entenstrasse was built in 1748/49, enlarged exactly a century later and renovated in 1925. Burials were conducted in Wachenheim, but the community was able to maintain a Jewish elementary school (established, at the latest, in 1856) and a mikveh. The district rabbinate of Frankenthal was based in Bad Frankenthal. Duerkheim was renamed Bad Duerkheim in 1904. By 1933, the Jewish communities of Grethen, Hardenburg, Ungstein, Leistadt, Kallstadt, Friedelsheim, Goennheim, Freinsheim and Weisenheim had all been affiliated with Bad Duerkheim, then one of the largest Jewish communities in the region. Active in the community were a brotherhood of Jewish youths (founded in 1820) and a Jewish sisterhood (founded in 1898), both of which looked after the sick and needy and assisted with burials. In 1932, Dr. Steckelmacher, the district rabbi, was instructing 18 children in religion; he perished in Lublin-Majdanek in 1943. Another prominent figure was the vocational teacher Ludwig Strauss, who served the community from 1875 until 1940. On Pogrom Night, SA men demolished the synagogue and ravaged 25 Jewish homes and stores; the Torah scrolls and the hearse were set on fire at the marketplace. Four Jewish men were sent to Dachau.

It was not, however, until 1848/50 that the Jewish community of Bad Freienwalde was officially founded. The local spa, popular among Berlin Jews, would later be referred to contemptuously as the Judenbad (Jew’s bath). On Pogrom Night, SA men set fire to the synagogue.

The first available record of a cemetery is dated 1730, years after it was consecrated. The cemetery was desecrated in 1885 and closed in 1895, after which the authorities gave the Jewish community land for new burial grounds. By 1812, the community had established a prayer hall in a private residence. A synagogue was inaugurated in 1850, and we also know that a considerably larger one was opened in Mehlem (an affiliated community) in 1875. Schoolchildren studied religion with teachers from neighboring communities until the late 19th century, when the community hired a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. In 1933, seven schoolchildren received religious instruction. A women’s association and a charity society were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, the synagogues in Bad Godesberg and Mehlem were set on fire; Jewish businesses and homes were destroyed. The Godesberg synagogue site was cleared in 1939, after which the land was sold to a local resident. Eighty-two local Jews emigrated from the country; others relocated within Germany. Beginning in 1939, the remaining Jews lived in so-called “Jews’ Houses.” In January 1942, some of the residents were moved to Cologne while the others were placed in a former monastery in Bonn-Endenich, places from which they were later deported to the East.

Bad Homburg vor der Hoehe,1335,604 in 1865,approximately 300,"Jews received permission to settle in Bad Homburg in 1335, but disappeared from the town after the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. A Jewish presence had been reestablished there by the 16th century. In 1684, Jews were granted permission to consecrate a cemetery and conduct religious services in a private residence; the cemetery was closed in 1790, after which burials took place in Seulberg until 1865, when a new cemetery was consecrated in Bad Homburg. The community established two synagogues: one in 1732, the other in 1866; the latter, built at 8 Elisabethenstrasse, was renovated in 1904 to accommodate 320 men and 104 women. The Jewish community center—it housed a weekday prayer hall, schoolrooms, a teacher’s apartment and a mikveh—was opened nearby in 1877. Beginning in 1851, the Jews of Bad Homburg employed their own rabbi. The town was home to three renowned Jewish sanatoriums and two kosher hotels. In 1909, the founding conference of Agudath Israel, the international Orthodox association, took place in Bad Homburg. After World War I, Bad Homburg was a center of Hebrew culture; several leading writers, such as Bialik and Agnon, resided there for a few years. In 1933, 60 schoolchildren studied religion in Bad Homburg. Dr. Leopold Wreschner was rabbi. The cemetery was desecrated in 1934 and in 1935. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, after which the building was burned to the ground. Jewish businesses and homes were wrecked, property was destroyed or looted and Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald. Most Jews left Bad Homburg. Thirty-nine were deported to the East in April and August of 1942; three women, all of whom were married to Gentiles, were deported to Theresienstadt in June 1943. At least 146 local Jews perished in the Shoah. A playground was later built on the synagogue site, and the former Jewish school is now a high school. A memorial and several plaques have been unveiled to commemorate the Jews and their synagogue.","Nurit Borut; Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-HNF",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=148,148
Bad Hersfeld,1347,325 in 1910,273,"Although Jews received permission to settle in Bad Hersfeld in 1347, they were massacred in the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. In 1362, however, another Jewish presence was established in Bad Hersfeld. Jews disappeared from the town in the 18th century, but returned in 1809/10, after which they belonged to the Niederaula community until the establishment, in 1878, of the Jewish community of Bad Hersfeld. The community of the Middle Ages maintained a synagogue and a cemetery. Members of the modern community prayed in Niederaula until 1877, when a prayer hall was inaugurated at Unteren Frauengasse. Local Jews established an elementary school and a new cemetery in 1878; then a synagogue, on Kaiserstrasse, in 1896; and a school building—it housed a mikveh—in 1898. The synagogue was desecrated and damaged in 1924. In 1933, 27 pupils attended the elementary school and 14 others received religious instruction. Several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide organizations were active in the community. In January 1933, four Jews were stabbed by SA men. Several Jewish homes and businesses were attacked that year. On November 8, 1938, two days before Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned to the ground and the school destroyed. Jews were assaulted in the streets, and Jewish businesses (including a boardinghouse) and homes were vandalized and ransacked. In total, 116 Jews emigrated (54 to the United States), 140 relocated within Germany, 17 died in Bad Hersfeld and 23 were deported to Riga (December 1941), Majdanek (May 1942) and Theresienstadt (September 1942). At least 80 Bad Hersfeld Jews perished in the Shoah. A movie theater was later built on the synagogue site, but a memorial and several plaques have been unveiled in town.

Bad Kissingen,1298,504 in 1925,344,"The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Bad Kissingen refers to the anti-Jewish Rindfleisch massacres of 1298. Bad Kissingen’s Jewish community peaked in 1925 at 504 persons, the majority of whom worked in the tourism industry generated by the town’s mineral spa. The community, home to a district rabbinate after 1839, employed its own rabbi. Local Jews established their first synagogue in 1705; a cemetery in 1801; a second synagogue, at 1 Promenadenstrasse (later renamed Max-Strasse) in 1902; and a medical clinic for Jewish children in 1905. The community employed a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan, shochet and synagogue caretaker. Dr. Max Ephraim was district rabbi in 1933. That year, several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide organizations were active in the community. Although Jewish-owned businesses were regularly attacked during the Nazi period, 15 Jewish boarding houses were still taking in lodgers in 1935. The cemetery was desecrated in May 1936. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire; Torah scrolls and ritual objects were confiscated; Jewish homes, stores and health facilities were heavily damaged; sixteen Jewish businesses were destroyed; and all Jewish men under the age of 70 were deported to Dachau. In total, 121 Bad Kissingen Jews emigrated, 143 relocated within Germany and 34 died in the town. Of the 43 Jews who still lived in Bad Kissingen in 1942, 23 were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in April; the others were later deported to Theresienstadt. At least 59 local Jews perished in the Shoah. After the war, many Jews lived in a displaced persons camp in Bad Kissingen (closed in 1948). A new prayer hall for Jewish spa guests was opened in 1956 and renovated in 1996. In 2002, a memorial was unveiled at the former synagogue site.

Bad Koenig,early 18th century,100 in 1880,72,"Jews lived in Koenig (renamed Bad Koenig in the early 19th century) from the early 1700s onwards. The Jewish community, founded in the late 18th century, established a synagogue on the corner of 11 Alexanderstrasse/Bleichstrasse in 1795/97 (renovated in 1897). Schoolchildren studied religion under the guidance of a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. The community buried its dead in Michelstadt until a cemetery was opened in Bad Koenig in 1925/26. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, its ritual objects desecrated; businesses and homes were wrecked and plundered. Jewish men were detained in the cellar of the council building, beaten—a 96-year-old man died of his wounds—and then taken out for a mock execution, after which five men were sent to Buchenwald. The cemetery was desecrated that night. Later, in 1939, the synagogue building was demolished. Twenty-eight Jews emigrated (16 to the United States), 45 relocated within Germany and five died in Bad Koenig. The last Jews left in March 1939. At least 27 Bad Koenig Jews perished in the Shoah.

Bad Honnef,1622 (three Jews),68 in 1911,34,"The Jewish community of Bad Honnef never exceeded 1% of the total population. Excepting the years between 1887 and 1913, the community was too small to form an independent congregation, and chose instead to join those of neighboring towns. During the second half of the 19th century, services were conducted in rented houses; on or about the turn of the century, however, the community purchased an abandoned church building and established a synagogue (it was inaugurated in 1902) there. Burials were conducted in nearby Selhof. Local Jews were actively involved in public life during the Weimar period, but it was then, too, that anti-Semitism intensified in Bad Honnef. Later, during the 1930s, Jewish- owned businesses were shut down. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue’s interior on fire and destroyed the furniture and ritual objects. Jewish homes were not plundered that night, but three local Jews were arrested. Of the 34 Jews who lived in Bad Honnef in 1933, 22 immigrated (10 of them to the United States). In 1941 and 1942, at least eight were deported to the East, where they perished. Only three Jews, all of whom were married to Gentiles, remained in Bad Honnef after the deportations; and only one of the deported Jews returned to the town after the war. In 1968, on the 30th anniversary of Pogrom Night, the municipality unveiled a memorial at the 300-year-old Jewish cemetery. In 1979, a bronze plaque bearing a picture of the synagogue and a menorah was placed at the synagogue site.","Moshe Aumann; Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=149,149

The records indicate that Jews lived in the town in 1580 and 1746. The community’s first synagogue, presumably built in the mid-19th century, also housed a school and a mikveh; this synagogue was renovated in 1929. In 1904, another house of worship was inaugurated at Unteressfelderstrasse (later renamed Bamburgerstrasse). Burials were conducted in nearby Kleinbardorf until 1921, when the community consecrated its own cemetery. In 1933, four Jewish associations were active in Bad Koenigshofen. Eighteen children attended the Jewish school. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; Jewish men were forced to chop up the Torah ark and the furniture for firewood, after which the building was burned down. That same night, all of the cemetery’s gravestones were smashed. Eight Jewish men were deported to Dachau. Forty-two Bad Koenigshofen Jews emigrated, 47 relocated within Germany and seven died in the town. The last six Jews, sent to Kleineibstadt in August 1941, were deported to Izbica in April 1942.

Bad Kreuznach,13th century,713 in 1933,,"A considerable number of Jews are thought to have lived in Bad Kreuznach during the early 14th century, given that records tell us that a rabbi was active there in 1338. Although this community was annihilated in the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, a new Jewish presence was established in the town in 1375. The Jews of Bad Kreuznach established the following communal institutions: a cemetery in the 16th century; a new cemetery, which was enlarged on several occasions, in the 17th century; a synagogue on Kleine Eselsgass (later, 2 Faehrgasse) in, at the latest, 1715; a new synagogue on the same site in 1737; and a short-lived private Jewish school in 1820. In 1844, by which point the community was one of the most important in the region and a district rabbinate was based there, the synagogue was renovated. Records mention a mikveh, but we do not know when or where it was built. We know for certain, however, that a Jewish children’s sanatorium was founded in Bad Kreuznach in 1920; the sanatorium had 118 beds in 1933. Prominent Bad Kreuznach Jews included the Baruch brothers, who won national and European championships in weightlifting and wrestling. In 1933, 75 schoolchildren studied religion under the guidance of the community’s teacher/chazzan. Several Jewish associations and branches of national Jewish organizations were active in the community, with which the Jews of Muenster-am-Stein and Planig were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior, closed down the children’s sanatorium and heavily damaged Jewish-owned homes and businesses. Jewish men were sent to Dachau and Buchenwald. The synagogue was sold after the pogrom and heavily damaged during a wartime air raid; later, in 1953/54, the ruins were demolished. Seventy-six Bad Kreuznach Jews were deported to the East in 1942. Two Jews, the town’s last, were deported to Theresienstadt in January 1945. At least 223 Bad Kreuznach Jews perished in the Shoah. The new Jewish community of Bad Kreuznach, established after the war, inaugurated a synagogue in 2002. The Jewish cemetery was desecrated again one year later.

Bad Laasphe,17th century,151 in 1880,unknown (127 in 1934),"The records suggest that Jews began to settle in Bad Laasphe towards the end of the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648), earning their livelihoods as merchants, cattle and textile traders, and butchers. The community built a synagogue in 1721, followed by another in 1750. In the late 1860s, the building was expanded to include a mikveh and a school, the latter of which was officially recognized as an elementary school in 1869. It was during the 19th century, too, that the town’s Jewish population experienced significant growth: from 80 in 1810 to 151 in 1880 (out of a total population of 2,184). We also know that, at some point in the 1760s, the community consecrated a cemetery (a gift from the Count of Wittgensehen) next to to the Christian burial grounds. After World War II, good relations prevailed between Jewish and Christian residents of Bad Laasphe, with Jews becoming active in the town’s social life. This period of peaceful coexistence ended with the Nazis’ election victories, after which businesses were boycotted and Jewish traders excluded from the cattle markets. Jewish children were expelled from local public schools in 1934. On Pogrom Night, a mob broke into the synagogue and smashed the furniture and ritual objects before (this was done on the street) setting the contents on fire. Jewish homes and stores were heavily damaged on Pogrom Night, and local Jewish men were sent to Sachsenhausen. Beginning in 1933, 60 Jews left the town, 26 of them for the United States. Forty-three were deported to Zamosc (in Poland) in April 1942; and in July 1942, 18 others were deported to Theresienstadt. All but two perished.

Bad Mergentheim,1292,280 in 1895,196,"The first available record of a Jewish presence in Bad Mergentheim is dated 1292. These early inhabitants were persecuted in 1298, 1336 and 1349, at which point the community was destroyed. Few Jews lived in the town throughout the ensuing decades, and it was not, in fact, until 1658 that a new community was founded there. Bad Mergentheim would become the central Jewish community of the Deutscher Orden (German Order). The community not only employed a series of rabbis, but also hosted, beginning in 1832, a regional rabbinate. A prayer hall was opened in a private residence in 1656. Later, in 1762, a synagogue was built in the backyard of Baruch Simon’s—a court Jew and the grandfather of Ludwig Boerne—manor house. This prayer hall was renovated and enlarged in 1840 and 1912, and it later housed the rabbinate. Burials were conducted in a regional cemetery (consecrated in the 16th century), and we also know that local Jews maintained a mikveh and a school. In 1933, 196 Jews lived in Bad-Mergentheim: ten children received religious instruction. Dr. Moses Kahn was rabbi, and several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide organizations were active in the community that year. On Pogrom Night, SA men assaulted Jews, looted stores and threw Rabbi Kahn down a flight of stairs after cutting off his beard. The interiors of the school and synagogue were destroyed; the Torah Ark was defiled with bacon. All Jewish men were arrested, including the wounded rabbi, and 38 were sent to Dachau. Rabbi Kahn emigrated in 1939 but died shortly afterwards. By 1941, 123 Jews had left the town. Eighteen Jews died in Bad-Mergentheim; thirty-five were deported to Riga, Izbica and Theresienstadt in 1941/1942. At least 61 Bad-Mergentheim Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue, renovated in 1946, was used by Jewish refugees and American soldiers. Sold in 1949, it was dismantled in 1957; the rabbinate house was demolished in 1975.

In 1895, the Jewish community of Langenbruecken became an affiliate of Bad Mingolsheim. In 1933, 13 Jews lived in Bad Mingolsheim and eight in Langenbruecken. Although the synagogue had been sold to a private citizen in April 1938—the new owner used the site as a barn and storage room—SA men still planned to set the building on fire on Pogrom Night. Prevented from doing so by the neighbors, they instead destroyed the building’s ritual objects. One Jew was sent to Dachau that night. Eight Jews (four from Bad Mingolsheim and four from Langenbruecken) managed to emigrate; another four relocated within Germany. On October 22, 1940, four Mingolsheim Jews and one Jewish woman from Langenbruecken were deported to the Gurs concentration camp in France.

In 1896, a Jewish community was founded in Bad Neuenahr, of which the Jews of Wadenheim (a district within Bad Neuenahr) and Heimersheim were members. Local Jews established several communal institutions: a prayer hall in the Jewish-owned Zur Landkrone hotel, located in Wadenheim, in 1866; a cemetery in 1895; a synagogue in 1901; and a Jewish hospital for needy patients in 1910. Beginning in 1903, the community hired a teacher of religion. Twelve Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction in 1933, and we also know that a youth association and a society for the support of needy patients were active in the community that year. In 1937, the town was still home to three Jewish-owned hotels and two Jewish-owned sanatoria. Jewish tourists were barred from non-Jewish hotels in 1938.

Bad Nauheim,,350 at some point after 1933,198,"Jews lived in Bad Nauheim as early as the Middle Ages, but it was only in 1830 that a community was founded there. In 1839, the newly founded community established a prayer room. The growth of the Jewish population—triggered by the town’s fame as a health resort—necessitated a larger structure, and in 1866 a house of worship was inaugurated in Bad Nauheim (50 seats for men, 40 for women). In 1929, a new synagogue, seating 150 men and 100 women, was opened at 29 Karlstrasse; the building also housed a mikveh. Beginning in 1873, a teacher of religion who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet served the community. Records from 1683 mention a cemetery, and we also know that the community consecrated two others: one in 1865, the other in 1902. The town was home to several Jewish health spas and, in the early 1930s, 17 Jewish hotels and boardinghouses, and approximately 50 Jewish physicians and dentists. Anti-Semitic violence was less pervasive in Bad Nauheim during the 1930s than in most of Germany, for the town feared losing income from Jewish tourists. Accordingly, the Jewish population reached a new peak of 350 after 1933. The community maintained an elementary school between 1937 and 1940. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; the building was set on fire, but the blaze was extinguished. Jewish homes and businesses were destroyed and looted, community dignitaries were abused and all Jewish men under 60 were sent to Buchenwald, where one died.  Approximately 139 Jews emigrated, 190 relocated within Germany, 33 passed away in the town and 10 committed suicide.

Bad Polzin,1711,226 in 1880,120,"Jochim Salomon, a trader, was the first Jew to settle in Bad Polzin (present-day Polcyn Zdroj, Poland). He and his sons traded in haberdashery, fur and wax; one of his sons eventually became a gravedigger, a fact that points to 1752 as the approximate year in which Bad Polzin’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated. Bad Polzin’s Jewish population grew during the late 18th century. Accordingly, the community established a synagogue (33 Muehlenstrasse), a mikveh and a community center. Religious instruction was provided by a teacher/cantor who played a central role in the community’s religious affairs. In 1881, as anti-Semitic riots erupted in Pomerania, Jewish-owned houses were destroyed in Bad Polzin, causing many to leave for safer areas. Nevertheless, Jews still made up 2% of the total population in 1925. The Nazi boycott reduced the sales of Jewish-owned businesses by 80 percent. In response to the increasingly dire economic situation, the remaining Jews sold their community center, school and mikveh. On Pogrom Night, an SS man shot and killed community member Leo Levy.

Two Jewish charity organizations and a women’s association were active in the town in 1933; 17 pupils attended the elementary school. In 1938, on the first day of the Jewish New Year holiday (September 26), the community leaders were ordered to clear out the synagogue immediately; the German army appropriated the building for grain storage. Thereafter the community held its prayer services in the school building. Later, in 1940, the synagogue’s metal objects were confiscated for scrap.

Although the community merged with that of Schoetmar in 1858, it continued to maintain its own synagogue. Salzuflen was home to a prayer room in 1598, soon after which, in 1603, the community received permission to establish a synagogue. The first available record of a cemetery is dated 1607, years after the burial grounds were consecrated. In 1670, 23 years after Jews returned to Salzuflen, the authorities permitted the community to conduct services in private residences. By 1704, local Jews had established a synagogue on 19-20 Lange Strasse. Deemed structurally unsafe in 1855, the building was demolished, after which, in 1856, a new synagogue was inaugurated on Mauerstrasse. The cemetery was enlarged in 1855, and we also know that schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from Schoetmar (after World War I, with one from Herford). On Pogrom Night, Bad Salzuflen’s synagogue was set on fire; the police confiscated the Torah scrolls, prayer books and ritual objects. Windows and property in three Jewish homes were smashed and destroyed, and a local Jew was sent to Buchenwald. Two days later, the synagogue’s ruins were removed, an expense for which the community was billed. The synagogue site was sold to the town in 1940/41. Several Jews moved to Bad-Salzuflen after 1933.

Jews conducted services in private residences until the establishment, in 1858, of a synagogue on 9 Gymnasialstrasse (renovated in 1904 and 1929). Bad Sobernheim’s Jewish elementary school, founded in 1840, later became a school for religious studies whose teacher performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. We also know that the community maintained a mikveh and a cemetery, the latter of which was established in the early 19th century and enlarged in 1856. In 1933, a chevra kadisha and a youth association were still active in the community.

Bad Soden was home to a prayer hall between 1762 and 1780, after which the town’s few Jews prayed in Niederhofheim. Inaugurated on Enggasse (present-day 2 Neugasse) in 1846, Bad Soden’s synagogue—26 seats for men, seven for women—was renovated in the late 19th century and in 1927. Burials were conducted in Niederhofheim until 1873, when the community consecrated its own cemetery. We also know that, in 1885, Baron Rothschild endowed the community with a sanatorium for indigent Jews. Jewish schoolchildren were able to study religion in Bad Soden—at times with teachers from Koenigstein/Kronberg and Falkenstein, at other times with a community-employed instructor. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed: axe-wielding rioters broke the furniture and Judaica, after which the objects were, together with the Torah scrolls and prayer books, taken outside and set on fire. The Jewish sanatorium was ransacked, its patients dragged outside and forced to watch the building burn. Five Jewish homes, the town’s last, were wrecked, and the windows in the funeral home were smashed. The synagogue building was later sold to a private individual. We also know that the cemetery was desecrated during the Nazi period, and that the funeral house was destroyed. Most of the remaining Jews fled to Frankfurt, where the sanatorium patients were also transferred. At least 15 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was later used a warehouse.

We also know that in 1840, prior to which local Jews used the cemetery in Bergen, the community consecrated its own burial grounds between Gronauer Weg and the general cemetery. In May 1938, windows in a Jewish home were smashed. Many Jews subsequently left Vilbel, and the community was disbanded in the summer of 1938, around which time the synagogue was sold. Nevertheless, on Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and furniture, burning (this was done outside) the Torah scrolls and ritual objects. The building, however, was spared, for it had been bought by non-Jews. Jewish homes and businesses were wrecked and looted, and Jewish men (all but the elderly) were sent to a concentration camp. Twenty-one Jews managed to emigrate, but most of the others relocated within Germany. Eight Jews were deported in September, 1942: five to Theresienstadt and three to Poland.

Earlier, in 1870, a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Bad Wildungen. The Jews of Bergheim maintained their own synagogue (inaugurated in 1883) and a regional cemetery. By the 1930s, however, only one Jewish family remained there. In 1933, 14 schoolchildren received religious instruction. In February, 1933, shots were fired into a Jewish home; later that year, in March, Jewish men were marched through the town and humiliated. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned to the ground. Jewish businesses and homes were wrecked, personal property destroyed or looted. Jews were assaulted, and one drowned in a lake while trying to escape. All Jews were detained at the municipality, after which the men were sent to Buchwald, where one was murdered. Eventually appropriated by the municipality, the synagogue was later demolished. Fifty-two Jews emigrated, 18 relocated within Germany and six left for unknown destinations. In October/November 1939, the remaining Jews were sent to Kassel.

A new community received a letter of protection from King Sigismund in 1416, but was expelled from the town by that century’s end. On May 5, 1877, by which point the town was home to a synagogue and a school (both located in the community center on Hafenmarkt), Bad Windsheim’s 12 Jewish families established a community. Local Jews built a mikveh in 1888, and we also know that burials were conducted in Obernzenn. Additional benches were installed in the synagogue in 1889, triggering a rise in attendance (89 regular attendees in 1896). Fifty-eight Jews lived in Bad Windsheim in 1933, half of whom had left by 1937.

Baden-Baden,16th century,435 in 1925,260,"Baden-Baden (Baden-Wuerttemberg) Between the 16th and 18th centuries, a handful of Jewish families lived in Baden-Baden. In 1862, Jews were allowed to settle there and were granted equal rights; accordingly, a community was founded in 1890. In 1899, the community replaced its old prayer hall (established in 1867) with a new synagogue. Later, in 1921, the Jews of this town (popular among wealthy Jews for its health spas) consecrated a Jewish cemetery. In response to the anti-Semitism rampant in Baden- Baden during the 1920s, Jews boycotted the town. In 1920, a Jew was murdered there by a radical nationalist. Baden-Baden was home to 260 Jewish residents in 1933. Several charity associations and branches of major Jewish organizations were active in the town, and the community had a teacher in its employment that year. Jews owned two hotels and an art gallery. The cultural and social life of the community continued to thrive well into the Nazi period. In 1937, Jews were forbidden to visit the town’s tourist facilities. On Pogrom Night, 80 Jews were rounded up and marched through the city center, after which they were crammed into the synagogue, forced to listen to anti-Semitic abuse and to practice gymnastics. The synagogue was set on fire that night—it was later razed to the ground—and Jewish-owned businesses were looted. Seventy-eight Baden-Baden Jews immigrated, 76 relocated within Germany, 21 died in Baden-Baden and six committed suicide. In October 1940, 114 Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least 113 Baden-Baden Jews perished during the Shoah.

During the 16th century, the town’s Jewish community was one of the most important in the Bayreuth margraviate. The fact that a rabbinate was based in Baiersdorf during the 17th century, and that the town later became home to the central rabbinate for the Bayreuth margraviate (until 1888) gives some indication of the community’s influence. The Jews of Baiersdorf established a new synagogue in 1651—its 15th-century predecessor had been destroyed in the Thirty Years’ War—and another synagogue (financed by Samson Solomon, a local court Jew) in 1711. Local Jews also maintained a mikveh. By 1938, all but three Jews had left Baiersdorf. The synagogue was nevertheless vandalized on Pogrom Night, and its furniture and mikveh were destroyed; the cemetery, too, was desecrated that night. After the pogrom, Baiersdorf ’s three remaining Jews were sent to Erlangen. One Jewish couple died in Fuerth. Only one Jewish woman—she was married to a Christian—survived the war in Baiersdorf.

Baiertal was home to a Jewish school between 1839 and 1868; in 1864, it was moved to a classroom in the synagogue. We also know that burials were conducted in Wiesloch. Baiertal’s Jewish population dwindled with the passage of time, but the community of the mid-1920s was still able to employ (for the benefit of the two remaining pupils) a teacher who commuted daily from Wiesloch. In 1933, 25 Jews lived in Baiertal. They maintained three charity associations, a chevra kadisha, a women’s association and a Gemilus Chassadim Society. Although the community had been dissolved in 1937, it was still targeted on Pogrom Night, when rioters set the synagogue’s contents on fire and looted Jewish-owned homes and stores.

Bamberg,1007,1269 in 1880,812,"Jews are said to have lived in Bamberg since its foundation in 1007, and there is evidence, dating from the 12th century, of a thriving Jewish community with its own quarter, synagogue, mikveh, school and wedding hall. Many Jews of the early community were prominent bankers, but their contributions to the town’s economy did not protect them from the pogroms of the Middle Ages; notable among these were the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298, the Black Death pogroms of 1348, the expulsions of the 15th century and the pogroms of the 17th century. Bamberg was home to many prominent Jewish residents: Rabbi Samuel ben Baruch (Samuel von Babenberg), founder of a renowned yeshiva (in approximately 1220); Rabbi Moshe Mints, one of the most important Talmudists of the 15th century; and Rabbi Shimon Rosenfeld, the first in Bavaria to deliver his sermons in German. As early as the 12th century, the Jews of Bamberg had a synagogue on the present-day Judengasse; this synagogue was converted into a church after the 14th-century community was expelled from the town. We also know that the community of the 15th century—it too, was expelled—had maintained a synagogue at Hellerstrasse, and that it was not until 1852 that another house of worship was built in Bamberg (on Generalsgasse, renovated and inaugurated in 1853). The growing community of the late 19th century built a synagogue at Herzog-Max-Strasse (inaugurated in 1910); as the synagogue was Liberal, the Orthodox Adass Israel congregation conducted services in its own prayer hall at 9 Hellerstrasse. The modern community also maintained a school and a mikveh, both of which were established at some point after 1905. According to the records, the new cemetery at Siechenstrasse—it replaced an older cemetery at Walsdorf—was consecrated in the mid-19th century. By June 1933, 812 Jews, constituting 1.5% of the general population, lived in Bamberg. Although many Jewish institutions continued to flourish in Bamberg after the implementation of the anti-Jewish boycott, Jews began to leave the town in steadily growing numbers beginning in 1933. The synagogue, which housed ritual objects from the region’s many Jewish communities and 40 Torah scrolls, was burned down on Pogrom Night. The old synagogue was vandalized, as were Jewish homes, and local Jewish men were sent to Dachau. The 418 Jews who still lived in Bamberg in 1939 were eventually deported. By war’s end, 12 Jews (most likely spared because of their marriages to ethnic Germans) were still living in the town. There is a memorial plaque next to the former synagogue and cemetery. After the war, a large number of Jews, all awaiting emigration, lived at the Bamberg DP camp. Many Russian Jews settled in Bamberg after the fall of the Soviet Union, and at the time of this writing, the town was home to at least 800 Jews.","Benjamin Rosendahl; Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-B1",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=173,173

Expelled from the Lippe region in 1614, Jews did not return to Barntrup and Alverdissen until the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively. The two communities merged in the early 1860s. Although a synagogue existed in Barntrup in 1769, it was not in use by 1820, at which point local Jews prayed in Alverdissen and Bega. Later, in 1872, a synagogue was inaugurated in a private residence on Krumme Strasse; in Alverdissen, services were conducted in a rented prayer hall until the establishment of a synagogue in the mid-19th century. Cemeteries were consecrated in Alverdissen and Barntrup in 1747 and in the 19th century, respectively. We also know that the two communities intermittently hired a teacher, and that, beginning in the late 19th century, a teacher from Boesingfeld instructed the communities’ few school-age children. In 1902, Gustav Maybaum was elected as chairman of the Barntrup town council, but resistance among local people to a Jew holding this position forced him to resign. Renovated in 1909, the Barntrup synagogue was not used during the Weimar period, when the local Jewish population dwindled.

Only four Jewish widows lived there in 1770, but the town’s Jewish population experienced significant growth in the 19th century. Although the Jews of Battenberg did not maintain their own communal institutions—using, instead, the school, mikveh and cemetery in nearby Battenfeld—several Jewish teachers worked in Battenberg, among them Elias Birkenstein (1818-1831), one of the first teachers of the Reform movement in Hesse. Thirty-two Jews lived in Battenberg in 1933. By September 1939, only one Jewish family, the Isenberg-Stern family, lived there. The remaining six Jews were deported in 1942, and we also know that 16 local Jews were murdered in the Shoah. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue building was destroyed.

Bausendorf,1794,,33,"Very little is known about the history of Jewish Bausendorf. The earliest available records tell us that 13 Jews lived there in 1808, after which the Jewish population experienced modest growth (46 Jews, the peak population, in 1895). Nevertheless, the community managed to build a synagogue, consecrate a cemetery and found a school. The modest synagogue, which was built and inaugurated in 1880, also housed classrooms where Jewish children studied religion; in 1931, classes were discontinued as a result of insufficient enrolment numbers. By 1934, as a direct result of the Nazis’ anti-Jewish boycott, Bausendorf ’s Jewish population had dropped to below 20. Accordingly, synagogue services were discontinued. We know very little about what happened in Bausendorf on Pogrom Night, but the records do tell us that the synagogue was defaced and vandalized. The abandoned building was torn down in 1961.

The synagogue, renovated in the early 20th century, seated 65 men and 42 women. The school closed down in 1923, after which a teacher instructed the few remaining schoolchildren in religion. In 1933, 23 Jews lived in Battenfeld. The Jews of Battenberg (33), Laisa (6) and Rennerthausen (9) were affiliated with the community. The synagogue was burned to the ground on Pogrom Night. Two Jewish homes were ransacked, and Jewish men in Rennerthausen were arrested. The community was later forced to sell the synagogue site and school building. We also know that the cemetery was desecrated in 1938, and that many headstones were later used as building material. Seven Jews emigrated to the United States; the others relocated within Germany. Six Jews remained in Battenberg, and were deported to the East in 1942. At least six Battenfeld Jews and eight from Battenberg perished in the Shoah.

Jews were expelled from Bautzen several times during the following centuries, and the records also tell us that Bautzen Jews were accused of “debased coinage” in the 16th century. The Jewish community, founded towards the end of the 19th century (together with Jews from neighboring Bischofswerda and Kamenz) conducted services in private prayer rooms until a permanent prayer room was established on Topferstrasse. Around the year 1900, a Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Muskauerstrasse, near Gesundbrunnen. Most local Jews were well-respected merchants and craftsmen. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), Jews were forced out of their homes, chased through town and assaulted. Their homes were vandalized, and the prayer room was destroyed. Most Jews left Bautzen for Dresden, from where many men were sent to Buchenwald. Thirteen Jews were able to emigrate; the rest were deported in 1941/2. Only one survived. In 1949, the Bautzen district court sentenced some of the perpetrators of the November pogrom to long-term imprisonment. One year later, in 1950, a memorial plaque for the prisoners of a satellite camp of Gross-Rosen was unveiled in Bautzen.

In 1837, Bayreuth’s Jewish  community peaked at 530. During the Middle Ages, rabbis for the  entire principality lived in Bayreuth. The  town’s Jews established a synagogue on  Muenzgasse in 1760, a Talmud Torah school  in 1781, a mikveh in 1783, a cemetery in  1787 (expanded in 1846 and 1906) and an  elementary school in 1824. A community  rabbi was appointed in 1827: Joseph Aub,  the renowned Liberal rabbi, held this post  from 1829 until 1852. Bayreuth was home to  a district rabbinate between 1852 and 1936. In 1933, 261 Jews lived in Bayreuth. The  community ran several Jewish associations  and branches of nationwide Jewish organizations. Bayreuth’s  second, smaller synagogue was renovated in 1934, the same  year in which Nazis kidnapped a local Jew. On Pogrom Night, attackers wielding pickaxes and  crowbars destroyed the synagogue’s interior, furniture and  ritual objects; the community house and the Jewish school  suffered the same fate. Jewish homes and businesses were  looted, and the cemetery was damaged. Jewish men were  imprisoned locally, and several were deported to Dachau. At least 39 local Jews emigrated, 10 died in Bayreuth  and two committed suicide. Many others relocated within  Germany. The 80 Jews who still lived there at the end  of 1939 were forcibly moved into a few apartments. In  November 1941, 60 Jews were deported to Riga. Eleven  Jews, sent to Bamberg in January 1942, were later deported  to Theresienstadt. At least 144 Bayreuth Jews perished in  the Shoah. In 1946, the synagogue and cemetery were renovated  by a newly-established community of displaced Jews (most  left by 1948).

In July 1867, the  community celebrated the  completion of the construction with a splendid, two-day inauguration. This synagogue was  in use until October 1938. On Pogrom Night, SA and SS men stormed the synagogue  building. As they had been ordered not to burn it down, they  proceeded to demolish the interior with extra vengeance.  Everything was destroyed by hand; smashed methodically  and hurled onto the street. SA and SS men returned the  following morning and forced an elderly Jew to smash the  Hebrew words engraved above the entrance. Until it was torn down in 1967, the building was used  as an office space by various governmental agencies.

Jewish homes were attacked and looted, Jews were assaulted and a Jewish woman was raped and then publicly humiliated together with her husband, after which the couple attempted suicide. Jewish homes were also attacked the following night. Shortly afterwards, the municipality bought the synagogue, school and cemetery.

In 1732, Eliezer Sussmann, the renowned artist, painted the interior with exquisite murals. Bechhofen’s cemetery (the second largest in Bavaria) was used by Jewish communities throughout the region. We also know that the modern community maintained a mikveh. In 1933, the Jews of Bechhofen had in their employ a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan, shochet and undertaker. Two charitable societies (one for men, the other for women) were active in Bechhofen. No Jews lived in Bechhofen by October 1938, but that fact did not prevent rioters from burning down the synagogue on the morning before Pogrom Night. Ten Bechhofen Jews immigrated to the United States; others relocated in Germany. At least 25 Bechhofen Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial stone was later unveiled at the synagogue site.

A massive effort to rebuild it was launched, and in 1837 the new synagogue was completed. Due to a lack of funds, it was a small, poorly constructed building: The windows were of plain, rather than stained, glass, the furnishings were crude and a plain red cloth was used for the Torah curtain. On Pogrom Night, SA men destroyed the building quickly and easily. We also know that the Torah scrolls and prayer books were torn and strewn in the street.

While most small-town synagogues had a maximum of two Torah scrolls, Bedburg’s had six. On Pogrom Night, SA men, accompanied by members of the Hitler Youth, broke down the front door of the synagogue and systematically destroyed the building’s contents.

Berlichingen,1561,249 in 1846,68,"Founded in 1632 by the descendants of Jews expelled from Spain, this Jewish community would contribute greatly to Berlichingen’s development as a commercial center. It was in 1632, too, that a regional Jewish cemetery was consecrated there. Services were conducted in a private residence during the 1700s. In 1805/06, a synagogue with living quarters and a mikveh was built in Berlichingen. A school was in use until 1840, and again during the second half of the 1900s. The community—it appointed its own rabbi after 1809— was the seat of a regional rabbinate between 1832 and 1852. Although the community numbered 249 in 1846, the population declined during the second half of the century. In 1933, the 68 Jews of Berlichingen still maintained two charitable societies and a Jewish youth hostel. The synagogue was vandalized and its interior destroyed on Pogrom Night. Several houses were also destroyed, and three men were sent to Dachau. The community was disbanded and its synagogue demolished in 1939. Forty-three Berlichingen Jews emigrated from Germany; two relocated within the country, four died in the town, one committed suicide and one was killed in the Nazis’ “Euthanasia” project. Twenty-five local Jews were deported to the East in 1941/42, and at least 58 perished in the Shoah. A monument was unveiled at the cemetery in 1985.","Maren Cohen Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=200,200
Berlin (Introduction),1225,"173,000 in 1925",unknown,"The Middle Ages -  Berlin’s Jewish community, destined to become a center of Jewish religion and culture, was inconspicuous until the beginning of the 18th century. During the Middle Ages, Berlin’s Jews shared the fate of Jews in other parts of Germany: expulsion during the Black Death pogroms, readmission, further persecutions and, again, readmission under repressive conditions. Arguably, the community’s history commenced when the Elector of Brandenburg permitted several well- off families from Vienna’s expelled Jewish community to settle in Berlin (1671) and furnished them with letters of protection. A cemetery was purchased in 1672, and the first burial society, the Gemillus Chasodim, was founded in 1676. The community was not permitted to build a public synagogue until 1714, when the authorities relented and the first synagogue was inaugurated on Heidereutergasse (on New Year’s Day, 1714) in the presence of members of the royal court.  Rise of a Jewish Metropolis -  In the early 18th century, the legal status of the community was revised to include measures designed to extract exorbitant fees from its members. At the instigation of the merchant guilds, stringent regulations were introduced—limiting Jewish population growth, imposing penalties for the birth of additional children and restricting the inheritance of wealth—that created an atmosphere in which only successful Jews could survive; these included bankers, wholesalers, manufacturers and some army contractors of the Seven Years’ War. Further changes were set in motion by the arrival in Berlin, in 1743, of Moses Mendelssohn, a young Talmud student from Dessau who soon established himself as an expert in the liberal arts. Acclaimed by the leading Gentile thinkers of the day, he aimed to modernize Jewish identity. In order to help Jewish community to master the German language, as opposed to the Yiddish to which it was accustomed, he translated the Hebrew Bible into German written in Hebrew letters. Even though he was hailed by many, his ideas on education came under suspicion after his death in 1780, when many Jews converted to Christianity. However, Mendelssohn’s doctrine of combining secular and traditional studies had a lasting impact on Germany’s Jews. The first Reform synagogue, established by Israel Jacobson in 1810, was shut down by government authorities strongly suspicious of new “cults.” Still, Leopold Zunz and Edward Ganz managed to establish an association and a periodical, efforts that contributed to the establishment of a Reform congregation incorporating organ music, a vernacular service and the substitution of Sunday for Saturday as the day of rest. Samuel Holdheim became the leader of the Reform congregation in 1847. The wave of conversions to Christianity continued steadily, but this was offset by the influx of Jewish newcomers from Silesia, West Prussia and Posen who hailed from traditional backgrounds. Accordingly, the Jewish population grew from 3,000 to 8,000 during this period. The majority gravitated towards the liberal interpretation of Judaism; the Oranienburger Strasse synagogue, opened in 1866 in the presence of Count von Bismarck, installed Abraham Geiger, a distinguished scholar in the Mendelssohn mold, as rabbi, after which the Orthodox minority broke away and founded the Adass Yisroel association in 1869. With 300 original members and Rabbi Azriel Hildersheimer at the helm, Adass Yisroel eventually became Germany’s largest Orthodox community. The constitutional changes of March 1848 removed all restrictions on German Jews. Many Jews accordingly flourished, triggering a backlash of anti-Semitism, in response to which the community founded the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith. New arrivals poured into Berlin and the population quadrupled from 36,000 in 1871 to 142,000 in 1910. The newcomers (often treated condescendingly by the more established Jews) tended to congregate in the Scheinviertel area, creating their own milieu of Yiddish-speaking grocers, merchants and butchers. The upper classes continued to thrive in an array of professions. Intermarriage was common among more successful Jews, constituting 27% of all Jewish marriages in 1900, 34% in 1921 and 45% in 1929.  Postwar Consolidation -  In 1929, the community employed over 1,500 individuals and maintained 12 large synagogues (each accommodating an average of 2,000 people), as well as several smaller synagogues. Twenty synagogues were maintained by associations or private individuals, and numerous prayer halls (shtibel) were run by Eastern European immigrants. The community also maintained schools, ritual baths, libraries, a museum, a hospital, an orphanage, old-age homes, cemeteries and afterschool courses in religion. Forty-eight evening classes in religion were available for those children, the majority, who did not attend Jewish schools. The Abraham Geiger High School for Jewish Studies, founded in 1872—Martin Buber, Leo Baeck and Solomon Schechter taught there—and the Hildersheimer Rabbinical Seminary, founded in 1873 and made famous by David Zvi Hoffman and Yaacov Jehiel Weinberg, boasted outstanding academic reputations. The community was socially-minded: In addition to the Central Association, there were the war veterans’ and women’s groups, youth and sports clubs, cultural groups and Zionist clubs. Many periodicals were published, mostly in German, but also in Yiddish and Hebrew. The oft-ostracized Ostjuden (Jews of Eastern European descent), who by this point constituted a considerable chunk of the community, operated many of their own social clubs. The Nazi Period -  Despite widespread Jewish participation in Germany’s defense during World War I, resulting in a disproportionately high number of Jewish deaths in combat and awards to Jews for gallantry, anti-Semites blamed the defeat and subsequent economic hardships on the Jews. The Nazi party, flush with its victories in the Reichstag election of 1933, instituted a boycott of Jewish businesses and removed Jews from all strata of society: Department stores were placarded with anti-Jewish signs; contracts involving Jews were nullified; Jewish professionals, academics and state employees were removed from their positions; and schoolchildren and students were expelled from schools and universities. The community tried valiantly to alleviate the ensuing suffering by setting up schools, assisting the families of the unemployed and preparing Jews for emigration. In November of 1938, after a young Jewish student in Paris, incensed by the ill-treatment of his parents in Germany, shot and killed an official of the German embassy there, the Nazis unleashed a wave of violence against the Jews of Germany: Synagogues were wrecked or destroyed, homes were broken into and frightened children looked on as thugs smashed thousands of windows, giving rise to the naming of this nationwide pogrom as Kristallnacht (the Night of Broken Glass). As restrictions, harassments and summary arrests became the order of the day, Jews tried desperately to leave the country. When war broke out, however, 83,000 Jews still lived in Berlin; some were permitted to leave for neutral destinations, but the deportations to the concentration and death camps claimed most. Approximately 5,000 Jews, hidden and protected by Gentile spouses, survived the war in Berlin. Some 35,000 died in the camps; others died from starvation or sickness; and still others committed suicide. The last transport left Berlin in March 1945. Rebirth and Renewal -  Within five days of Germany’s defeat, the first postwar public Jewish service was held in Berlin. The few survivors were joined by nearly 2,000 survivors of the concentration camps (mostly from Theresienstadt, where conditions were less horrific than those further east). In February 1946, the official Jewish community was reestablished, and three intact synagogues were refurbished. Many of the returnees, broken by their experiences, left Germany, but their numbers were replenished by DPs (Displaced Persons) and, much later, by immigrants from the former USSR. (Russian speakers make up half of the present-day Jewish community in Berlin.) The community now maintains seven synagogues, two ritual baths, a yeshiva, a school, adult education classes, a library and a new Jewish museum, the last of which was designed by Daniel Libeskind. Two landmark events were the rebuilding of the Orianenburger Strasse synagogue and the unveiling of the controversial Shoah memorial designed by Peter Eisenman. Berlin is arguably home to the fastest-growing Jewish community in the Diaspora. ￼","Harold Zvi Slutzkin; Sources: EJ, EJL, WDJB",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=201,201
Bernburg,17th century,405 in 1864,195,"Jews established a significant presence in Bernburg during the 17th and 18th centuries. Although Bernburg Jews were highly influential in the courts, in business and in the professions, the government forced them to pay “protection money.” Among the town’s prominent Jewish residents was Rabbi Dr. Salomon Herxheimer, whose prolific work included a translation of the Hebrew Bible into German. The community conducted services in a synagogue (established in 1731) until a larger house of worship was consecrated some 100 years later. Two hundred Jews lived in Bernburg in the early 1930s, but that number dwindled considerably after the Nazis implemented their boycott of Jewish-owned businesses (1933). On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was plundered and torched, Jewish-owned business and homes were destroyed and Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald. Of the 16 Bernburg Jews who were sent to Theresienstadt in 1942, only two survived. Bernburg was the site of a notorious psychiatric hospital where approximately 5,000 individuals, mostly Jews from the concentration camps, were “euthanized” with carbon monoxide gas. The synagogue ruins were demolished soon after Pogrom Night. On November 9, 2000, a memorial dedicated to the former synagogue was unveiled in Bernburg.","Fred Gottlieb; Sources: JGEN, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=228,228
Berne,1790,64 in 1873,,"By 1820, the Jewish community of Berne had established a prayer hall, a schoolroom and an apartment for a teacher. In 1840, S.R. Hirsch, the Oldenburg regional rabbi, consecrated a synagogue in Berne. As was the case in many other small German towns, the Jewish population dwindled during the next few decades, so that in 1899 only two children studied religion in Berne. Many of those who remained, however, prospered financially. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 unleashed a wave of anti- Semitic rhetoric and legislation against the once-respected Jewish community of Berne. Dr. Louis Koopman, scion of one of the town’s first Jewish families and a respected lawyer, community leader and municipal official, was removed from his hard-earned positions, after which he managed to eke out a living as a lecturer in agricultural studies at the local Zionist Hachshara training camp. Dr. Koopman’s successor as community leader sold the synagogue in 1938, using the proceeds to enable the remaining families to flee Germany. Accordingly, the building was not set on fire on Pogrom night; the furniture and ritual objects were, however, thrown out and burned. At the time of writing, passersby would see no indication that the still-intact building was once a house of worship.",Harold Slutzkin; Sources: LJG,http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=229,229
Bernkastel-Kues,1289 (see below),110 in 1886,59,"Jewish life in Bernkastel began as violently as it ended, with a blood libel pogrom in 1289. Later, during the Black Death pogroms of 1349/49, the Jewish community was annihilated. Successive communities were driven out, and it was not until the 17th century that a lasting Jewish presence was established in the village. A 14th-century synagogue was confiscated after the Black Death pogroms. Beginning in the 17th century, the community used prayer rooms in private residences. Finally, in 1852, a synagogue with a mikveh was dedicated at 77 Burgstrasse; the synagogue was destroyed by fire in 1880, after which, in 1882, it was rebuilt and rededicated. The community established two cemeteries: one in 1650, the other in 1866. Bernkastel was home to a Jewish elementary school— it was presided over by a teacher who also functioned as chazzan and shochet—between 1850 and 1866. After 1885, the teacher was responsible for providing religious instruction. In 1933, two children studied religion in Bernkastel. A Jewish women’s association, a men’s chevra kadisha, a youth association and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, SA men and local residents plundered the synagogue and destroyed its interior. The synagogue was sold to a German couple in April 1939. Thirty-two Jews from Bernkastel-Kues escaped the country and 15 fled to other parts of Germany. The last four were deported to Lodz, via Trier, in October 1940. At least 21 Jews from Bernkastel-Kues perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue was renovated into a cultural center in the 1980s.

Bernstadt on Weide,14th century,245 in 1871,52,"Jews lived in Bernstadt (Polish: Bierutow) during the Middle Ages, but the town was one of three in the area with relatively small Jewish populations. In 1780, after the arrival in Bernstadt of Jews from Breslau, the Jewish population numbered 101. Burials were conducted at a local cemetery between 1765 and 1900, after which a new cemetery was consecrated in a small, somewhat sunken area on Vogelsang. In 1809, one year after the synagogue burned down in a fire, a new synagogue was inaugurated on Junkerstrasse. Ludwig Meidner (1884-1966), the famous expressionist painter and graphic artist, was born in Bernstadt, as was Horace Kallen (1882-1974), the Jewish-American philosopher. In 1932/33, the leaders of the community were Moritz Hollaender, Hans Perlberg and Simon Einstein. Moritz Ephraim headed the representation committee; Dr. Wahrmann was rabbi; Ismar Pakula served as teacher/ chazzan; Hans Perlberg headed the chevra kadisha; Elsa Jaretzki managed the sisterhood; and Mrs. Bronitzer headed a charitable organization for the sick. Seven children studied religion in Bernstadt in 1932/33. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, and Jewish-owned homes and businesses were heavily damaged.

Bettingen-Huettersdorf,1724,unknown,unknown (1935,"Bettingen Jews, first mentioned in records from 1724, formed their own community together with the Jews of Huettersdorf and Buprich. By 1837, however, the Jews of Bettingen belonged to the Huettersdorf community, which, 10 years later, was known as the community of Huettersdorf- Lebach. Too small to be recognized as a public community, Huettersdorf-Lebach did not enjoy the rights and privileges accorded to official Jewish communities. In 1897, the Jews of Lebach, aspiring to independent status, attempted to join the community of Saarwellingen as a sub-community but were refused. The Huettersdorf-Lebach community maintained a synagogue in Huettersdorf, first mentioned in 1850. In 1933, the community of Bettingen-Huettersdorf was still a Privatgemeinde (private community), with which the Jews of Lebach were affiliated.

Beuthen,13th century,"3,600 in 1925","3,200","The modern Jewish community of Beuthen (in present-day Poland) developed during the period of Swedish rule, when large numbers of Jews from Lesser Poland moved to Beuthen. Jews initially conducted services in private prayer halls, but in 1809 a synagogue was inaugurated in the city. The Jewish cemetery, acquired in 1735, was used until 1870. Although the community experienced rapid growth during the first half of the 19th century, most Jews remained poor, because the discriminatory policies of the local guilds prevented them from becoming craftsmen or skilled professionals. Several Beuthen Jews did, however, succeed in entering the salt, beer, liquor and saltpeter industries. Jews also participated in the life of the general community: a Jew was elected to the town council in 1808—later, in 1872, another served as a district judge—and eight local Jews fought in the Napoleonic wars. In 1869, the prospering community built a new synagogue in the Moorish architectural style. The Jews of Bethuen also maintained an elementary school, an old-age home, a Talmud Torah, an Orthodox cheder (elementary school) and several private religious schools. After World War I, various social and welfare associations, e.g., the Association of Jewish Artisans, the Jewish Historical and Literary Society, Zionist groups and an organization for Eastern European Jews, were established in Bethuen. Markus Kopfstein (1889-1924), the congregational rabbi, wrote a full history of the community in which he describes the post-war proliferation of social-minded organizations. Although Beuthen Jews were, until 1937, protected by the League of Nations convention on minority rights, acts of anti-Semitic violence often broke out during the 1920s and 1930s: Jews were assaulted on the streets as early as 1923; others were forced to carry humiliating placards (“I’m Going to Palestine,” for example); and in 1932, Nazi sympathizers tried to kill a local merchant by tossing hand grenades into his home. (Angry demonstrations took place in Beuthen after one of the culprits was convicted.) In 1938, as in the rest of Germany, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe were expelled from Beuthen. Several weeks later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire, approximately 70 Jewish-owned stores were destroyed and many Jewish householders were arrested, after which some were sent to Buchenwald. In 1942, 1,300 still lived in Beuthen; of these, approximately 50, all married to non-Jews, were spared deportation. After the war, survivors established a new Jewish community in Beuthen; they never built a synagogue, but did maintain an office and a prayer hall.

The community maintained its own mikveh, but conducted burials in Wiesbaden. Toni Sender (1888-1964), daughter of the community’s chairman and a prominent communist, was one of the first women elected to the Reichstag, where she served until 1933. That same year, 150 Jews lived in Biebrich. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were Jewish homes and businesses. Most Jews managed to leave Biebrich. Those remaining were eventually deported to the East, some to Theresienstadt, via Wiesbaden, in April 1943. At least 30 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was destroyed during an aerial bombing in 1944. The ruins were subsequently cleared, and after the war a house and a commercial building were built on the site. In 1979, a memorial plaque was affixed to the council building.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-HNF",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=242,242
Bierstadt,late 16th century,72 in 1925,48,"The history of Jewish Bierstadt began in the late 16th century. In 1827, an actual community was founded there, with which the Jews of Dotzheim, Erbenheim, Igstadt and Kloppenheim were affiliated. Bierstadt and its affiliated communities became part of Wiesbaden in 1928, but the community retained its independence. Services were conducted in a prayer room, located in a private house, until 1827, when the newly founded community inaugurated a synagogue on the corner of Rathausstrasse/ Kirchgasse (present-day 5 Poststrasse/ Kirchbornstrasse) seating 48 men and 25 women; the house of worship was renovated in 1927. The community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Although local Jews were able to maintain their own mikveh, they buried their dead in Wiesbaden. We also know that in 1890, a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Bierstadt. Forty-eight Jews lived in Bierstadt in 1933. Five schoolchildren studied religion there, and a chevra kadisha was active in the community. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, after which the building was used as a warehouse. At least 23 Bierstadt Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was demolished in 1971. In 1980, a memorial plaque was affixed to a nearby building; another memorial commemorates the destroyed cemetery.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-HNF",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=244,244
Bielefeld,1345,980 in 1900,797,"The Jewish community of Bielefeld developed in the mid- 17th century. The community’s first cemetery, located outside the city gates, was consecrated in 1660. By 1705, local Jews had established prayer rooms in several homes; the rooms were moved to different locations on several occasions before 1847, when the congregation inaugurated a synagogue, with a mikveh and organ, on Klosterstrasse. Many Bielefeld Jews traded in textiles, and by the beginning of the 19th century they were dominating the town’s textile industry. The Liberal congregation had a mixed choir, conducted its services in German and even rescinded, in 1856, the requirement for a minyan. Bielefeld’s Jewish elementary school—which had been operating in a private residence on Am Damm since 1825, later moving to the Klosterstrasse synagogue—closed in 1876. In 1891, a new Jewish cemetery was consecrated next to the Johannesfriedhof. The Klosterstrasse synagogue deteriorated as the years went by, and the building was demolished in 1906, one year after the inauguration of a new synagogue at 5 Turnerstrasse. The new house of worship not only provided seating for 450 men and 350 women, with separate entrances, but also housed an additional prayer hall for Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe. There was a Jewish community center next door. Local Jews were active in public life and ran a sisterhood, a youth organization and a chevra kadisha. At some point in the 20th century, the community became the regional center for the Jewish youth movement in Northwest Germany; beginning in 1921, the ORT, the Scouts and Hechalutz (the Pioneer Association) conducted Zionist activities in Bielefeld. Restrictions were imposed on Jewish residents immediately after the Nazis’ election victories, affecting their businesses, financial standing and everyday lives. Mass emigration began in 1935. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue and its neighboring administrative building on fire, but not before stealing the Torah scrolls and silverware. Jewish homes and stores were ravaged (some were plundered), men were physically attacked and up to 50 were arrested. Two hundred Jewish residents left Bielefeld during the following ten months. After the pogrom, Bielefeld’s Jews were forcibly moved into collective, Jewish-only housing and assigned to forced labor; their children were expelled from German schools. A “re-education camp” accommodated Jews from elsewhere, and they, too, were sent to perform forced labor at a camp, over which a local Jew was put in charge under Gestapo supervision. At least 509 Bielefeld Jews, who were eventually deported in a total of nine transports, perished in the Shoah. After the war, 52 Jews returned to Bielefeld and resumed communal activities. A synagogue and community center were set up in 1963; and a memorial stone, bearing a picture of the destroyed synagogue, was unveiled in 1978.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, FJG, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=243,243
Bigge,late 1700s,72 in 1928,28,"In 1808, when the Jews of Bigge established a synagogue, they did not construct it from scratch but instead used an existing building. During its infancy, the community belonged, together with the Jewish communities of the surrounding towns, to an association of synagogues. The Jewish community of Bigge became an independent community in 1905. In 1901, the community established an elementary school—it also housed an apartment for a teacher—and a cemetery. Both synagogue and school, the latter of which was located near the house of worship, were enlarged in 1906. On Pogrom Night, although SA men arrived in Bigge with the intent to burn down the synagogue, they were prevented from doing so by neighboring residents who feared for the safety of their own homes; instead, the SA plundered the synagogue and burned its ritual objects in the courtyard. The building was razed in 1939. The old synagogue site is now part of a street. A memorial tablet, the only reminder that a house of worship once stood on the site, has been unveiled nearby.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=245,245
Billigheim,late 1600s,,30,"Jews arrived in Billigheim after the Thirty Years’ War; by 1722, 10 Jewish families lived in the village. The community enjoyed the protection of the Bishop of Mainz, who governed the area until 1806 and rejected requests to restrict Jewish rights. In 1804, local Jews built a synagogue with a classroom and living quarters for the teacher. The school was moved to another building in 1835, and operated until 1876, when all confessional schools in Baden were closed. The community maintained a mikveh, a women’s association, and a cemetery in Neudenau. On Pogrom Night, SA men destroyed the synagogue: The furnishings, windows and ritual items were smashed, and a grenade was thrown down the chimney. The SA did not set fire to the synagogue because a Christian tailor residing within it refused to leave the premises. Five local Jews emigrated before 1938; five relocated within Germany; seven fled after the pogrom; and three died in Billigheim. Ten Jews, Billigheim’s last, were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 12 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was eventually transferred to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, which sold it in 1952. The building was demolished in 1990, 10 years after a memorial plaque had been unveiled at the municipal cemetery.","Maren Cohen  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=246,246
Billigheim,1510,109 in 1858 (10% of the total population),35,"The first available record of a Jewish family in Billigheim is dated 1510. It was not, however, until 1710, when Jews were granted residency rights, that Jewish residents were again mentioned in the town’s records. For most of the 19th  century, Billigheim’s Jewish population was approximately 100, a number that dwindled to approximately 70 in the early 20th century and to less than 40 after World War I. Records from 1842 mention a synagogue that had been established “approximately 80 years ago,” allowing us to estimate that the synagogue on 170 Fuerthstrasse had been inaugurated in or around 1742 (20 years after local Jews formed a minyan). We also know that the town was home to a Jewish school and a mikveh, and that burials were conducted in in Ingenheim. Thirty-five Jews, most of whom were cattle dealers and shop owners, lived in Billigheim in 1933. Later, on Pogrom Night, when only 16 Jews lived in Billigheim, the synagogue building was set on fire; the SS and SA prevented attempts to extinguish the blaze, and the building burned to the ground. All local Jewish men were arrested on Pogrom Night. In 1942, the town’s remaining five Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. Fourteen Billigheim Jews perished in the Shoah, nine of them at Auschwitz. Billigheim no longer has a Jewish community.

Binau,late 1700s or early 1800s,146 in 1839,20,"This community, which belonged to the regional rabbinate of Mosbach from 1827 onwards, built a synagogue with living quarters and a mikveh in 1790. It was during the 18th century, too, that a cemetery was consecrated in Binau. The school for religious studies (1835-1875) was presided over by a local teacher who was a ritual slaughterer and cantor; later, this post was filled by a teacher from out of town. In 1933, 20 Jews lived in Binau. A teacher from Heinsheim instructed three children in religion, and a women’s association organized charitable activities. Local Jews did not at first suffer from the Nazis’ anti-Jewish boycott: It was not until 1936, in fact, that the authorities shut down Jewish-owned businesses, after which Jews had to live on their savings or work as agricultural laborers. Seven Binau Jews immigrated to the United States that same year. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue interior was destroyed and five Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Afterwards, three Jews emigrated and another three relocated within Germany. On October 22, 1940, the remaining seven Jews were deported to the Gurs camp in France. At least 11 Binau Jews perished in the Shoah. Converted into a post office after the war, the former synagogue is now a residential building (7 Reichenbucher Strasse).","Maren Cohen  Sources: AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=248,248
Bingen,10th century,713 in 1900,465,"Bingen’s medieval Jewish community maintained a synagogue, a school and a mikveh. In 1490 and in 1689, synagogues in Bingen were destroyed by fire. A new synagogue was established on the Judengasse in 1700, and although it, too, was damaged by fire in 1789, the building was subsequently renovated and enlarged. Rebuilt between 1831 and 1838, the synagogue was renovated on several occasions, the last of which was in 1891. In 1871, after an organ was installed in the synagogue, the town’s Orthodox Jews decided to create a separate community with their own rabbi and prayer hall (the latter was dedicated in 1876). In 1905, the mainstream community built a larger synagogue—218 seats for men, 171 for women and 60 Torah scrolls—at 10-12 Rochusstrasse. Bingen’s Jewish cemetery, consecrated in 1562, was enlarged in 1856. The Orthodox section—it had been established in 1872—was desecrated in 1889, as was the general section in 1905. We also know that the community ran a Jewish school between 1826 and 1835. In 1933, a teacher/chazzan instructed 56 schoolchildren in religion. The general community’s rabbi was Ignatz Maybaum. Several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide Jewish organizations were active in Bingen. On Pogrom Night, rioters wrecked the Rochusstrasse synagogue, after which the building was set on fire. The interior of the Orthodox prayer room was destroyed, ritual objects from both buildings were thrown onto the street, all Jewish-owned stores and many Jewish homes were damaged and Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps. The synagogue ruins were sold to a local group of residents who opened a wine shop in the damaged building. Two hundred and ninety-six Bingen Jews either emigrated from or relocated in Germany before 1941. The remaining Jews were moved into a few Jewish-owned homes. In March 1942, 76 were deported to Piaski and 64 to Theresienstadt; and in September 1942, six were deported to Theresienstadt, as were four others in February 1943. At least 264 Bingen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Binningen,1757,80 in 1817 (approximately 24% of the total population),26,"Although we do not know when this community replaced its 17th-century prayer room with the synagogue at 61 Hauptstrasse, records do tell us that the synagogue was renovated in 1841. The nearby Jewish school (63 Hauptstrasse) was closed down at the end of the 19th century, after which the community employed a teacher of religion who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. The Jews of Binningen also maintained a mikveh, a regional cemetery, and communal institutions that also served the Jews of nearby Brohl, Duenfus, Forst, Gamlen, Hambuch, Kaifenheim, Moentenich, Moselkern, Mueden, Roes and Wirfus. On Pogrom Night, the interiors of both the synagogue and the school were destroyed; Torah scrolls, ritual objects and books were taken into the yard and burned. Jews were assaulted, Jewish-owned homes and business were ransacked and several Jewish men were arrested. Jakob Haas was beaten so badly that he died of his wounds on May 21, 1939. At least 39 Jewish residents of Binningen, 11 from Hambuch, two from Gamlen, and three from Duenfus, Kaifenheim and Wirfus, respectively, perished in the Shoah. Binningen’s cemetery was desecrated several times during the Nazi period (and once after 1945). The synagogue building was converted into a private residence, probably in 1957.

The community maintained a yeshiva for a brief period during the 19th century, but details about its construction and enrollment are unavailable. In 1933, local Jews employed a teacher and maintained a chevra kadisha and a charitable society. A matzo bakery still did business in Binswangen that year. The cemetery was vandalized in 1938 and in 1942. On the morning after Pogrom Night, SA men and local vandals destroyed the synagogue’s interior, confiscated the Torah scrolls and other valuables, smashed the remaining ritual objects and broke the windows of Jewish stores and several homes. Several Jews were sent to Dachau. The seven Jews who still lived in Binswangen in 1942 were deported: five to Piaski (via Munich), and two to Theresienstadt (also via Munich). At least 38 Binswangen Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was restored and reopened in 1996.

Birkenau,1679,120 in 1872,35,"Birkenau was home to a small synagogue building in 1823, and although it was sold to a local Jew in 1833, the community continued to conduct services there. In 1859, six years after the synagogue burned down, a new house of worship—40 seats for men, 20 for women—was inaugurated at 17 Obergasse. The Jews of Birkenau operated a school between 1817 and 1835, after which they employed a teacher of religion who also served as shochet and chazzan. Birkenau’s Jewish cemetery (on Kallstaedter Talstrasse) had been purchased in 1717. In response to dwindling Jewish population numbers, the synagogue was sold to the municipality on November 9, 1938. On Pogrom Night, SA men broke into the synagogue and set its contents on fire. The synagogue was damaged heavily, but the fire brigade, hoping to appropriate the building, extinguished the blaze. Jewish homes were looted that night, and Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen. The synagogue was demolished in 1940. Nineteen local Jews emigrated; one died in Birkenau. In February 1942, the remaining 14 Jews were moved into a Judenhaus from which they were deported to Poland and Theresienstadt in March and September of 1942.

Birkenfeld,1808,76 in 1900,37,"Birkenfeld Jews belonged to the Hoppstaedten community until 1892, when they gained the status of a sub-community (Filialgemeinde). The independent Jewish community of Birkenfeld was founded in 1923. The community established a prayer hall in 1831/32, but it was closed down when the Hoppstaedten community demanded that Birkenfeld Jews attend services in Hoppstaedten. Nevertheless, in 1863, a synagogue was inaugurated at 5 Schlossallee (renovated in 1912/13). The Jewish cemetery in Birkenfeld dates back to the 1890s. Until 1914, the community employed a teacher of religion who also functioned as chazzan and shochet. During the Weimar period and after, religious instruction was provided by the Hoppstaedten rabbi. By the end of the 1920s, regular services were no longer held in the Birkenfeld synagogue. In 1933, eight schoolchildren received religious instruction. A Jewish women’s association and a charitable society were active in the community that year. Although the Birkenfeld synagogue had been sold in May 1938, it was nevertheless set on fire on Pogrom Night. The blaze was quickly extinguished, but rioters broke the synagogue’s windows and those in Jewish homes. Stones from the synagogue—the building was demolished in March 1939—were used to build a government office. Most Jews left Birkenfeld during the Nazi period. At least one Jew died in the village, and two Jewish women, Birkenfeld’s last, were deported to the East in April 1942. At least 12 Birkenfeld Jews perished in the Shoah.

Bischofsheim,1770,82 in 1881,22 (five in affiliated Ginsheim),"Bischofsheim’s local Jews were members of the Jewish community of Ruesselsheim until 1826, when they founded their own community. In 1848, Bischofsheim Jews replaced their prayer hall with a synagogue at 46 Frankfurter Strasse; thoroughly renovated in 1873, the synagogue housed a mikveh. Until the 20th century, the community employed a teacher of religion who also served as chazzan and shochet. Burials took place in Gross-Gerau. In 1933, a teacher from Gross-Gerau instructed local Jewish children in religion. Later, in April 1938, the community turned down a neighbor’s offer to purchase the synagogue. On Pogrom Night, just as SA men were breaking into the synagogue, the neighbor’s wife once again offered to buy it, and this time she received an affirmative answer. Although she managed to prevent the SA from destroying the building, it was nonetheless damaged. Torah scrolls, ritual objects and the contents of a Jewish-owned textile business were burned. On the afternoon of Pogrom Night, the SA and local schoolchildren broke the windows and doors of Jewish homes; in Ginsheim, a workshop belonging to a Jewish tailor was wrecked. During the Nazi period, several Jews moved to Bischofsheim, which was then a suburb of Mainz, and two Jewish babies were born there. Twenty-three local Jews emigrated, eight relocated within Germany and one died in Bischofsheim.

The foundation stone for a new synagogue was laid in 1877, but lack of funds delayed construction for another two years; the new synagogue also housed a mikveh and a classroom. After 1890, burials were conducted in the cemetery on Erdorfer Strasse. The community was able, for an unspecified period, to employ a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of shochet and chazzan. By 1925, however, Jewish schoolchildren were tutored in private residences. In 1933, twelve schoolchildren received religious instruction. Bitburg’s Jewish women’s association had 18 members.

The modern community emerged in the 18th century: a cemetery had been acquired by 1728, and in 1746 the community recorded its peak membership figure. In 1882, several Jews, having succeeded in the cattle and textile trades, funded a new synagogue to replace the rented prayer hall. Philanthropic Jewish citizens served on the town council until the early 1930s. The boycott of Jewish businesses crippled the community: by 1938/39, all Jewish business had been “Aryanized,” and nearly all local Jews had managed to emigrate.

The local magistrate shut it down after discovering its existence. The synagogue reopened a few years later, and remained in use until 1747, when the authorities once again shut it down. Finally, in 1798, after years of negotiations, Jews were granted permission to build a synagogue on condition that it would be modest and inconspicuous, and would not stand directly on the street— therefore the new house of worship was built behind an apartment building. We also know that the synagogue housed a mikveh, and that a school was later built on the site. By the late 1800s, the Jewish community of Bocholt was the largest in west Muensterland (northwest Germany, bordering the Netherlands). On Pogrom Night, SS and SA troops marched into the center of the town and split into two groups: One group set out to vandalize Jewish homes and businesses while the other set its sights on the synagogue. The latter, after breaking the doors and smashing the windows of the synagogue, vandalized the interior and then proceeded to burn the ritual objects. Although the synagogue was set on fire, the fire department, fearing the possibility of damage to the surrounding buildings, extinguished the blaze. After Pogrom Night, a furniture manufacturer used the building as a storage site until it was destroyed in a bombing raid.

(Records suggest such a building may have been established in Bochum in 1650.) We also know that in 1863, ten years after the congregation was officially founded, a new house of worship—200 seats for men, 100 for women—was inaugurated at 16 Wilhelmstrasse (presentday Huestrasse); in 1895, the building was expanded to accommodate another 200 worshipers. Bochum’s Jewish school was established in 1730. Attendance became mandatory in 1820, and the school was moved to a building near Schuetzenbahn and to the new synagogue in 1850 and 1863, respectively. Officially licensed as an elementary school in 1883, it recorded its peak enrollment (125) in 1886. The oldest Jewish cemetery in Bochum, located at Buddenberg Gate, was bequeathed to the community in 1720. The cemetery was moved three times: to Wittenstrasse in 1822; to Friedhofstrasse in or around 1884; and to Wasserstrasse, in Wiemelshausen, in 1917. Many Eastern European Jews settled in Bochum at the turn of the century, some of whom joined the Liberal congregation while others established an Orthodox prayer room. In 1930, Bochum was home to the largest Jewish congregation in Westphalia. The community maintained a cheder for religious studies, a Hebrew school, a kindergarten, numerous charities and cultural associations and, beginning in 1905, summer holiday camps. Community member Otto Ruer was elected mayor in 1925. In 1933, after the Nazis’ election victories, Zionist activities intensified in Bochum. Later, in 1938, Jews of Polish origins were deported. On the evening of November 10, 1938, following an assembly, drunken members of the SA and SS set out to terrorize Jews. Jewish residents were assaulted, their homes and stores plundered and wrecked. The synagogue was set on fire around midnight, three hours after which the dome was detonated. Although the community secretary had managed to remove the Torah scrolls from the building before the destruction, no one knows what became of them. After the pogrom, the remaining Jews were moved to six designated “Jews’ Houses,” one of which was located in the interior of the destroyed school.

Burials were conducted in Windecken until 1714, at which point a Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Sophienstrasse; in 1927, one year before the cemetery was closed, students desecrated and overturned the headstones. In 1936/37, unemployed SA members received ideological, military and professional training in Bockenheim’s military barracks. The old hospital was converted into an unofficial concentration camp, apparently run by the SA. The synagogue was set on fire on Pogrom Night, and hundreds of Jews from Frankfurt and Bockenheim— Bockenheim was classified as a district of Frankfurt am Main in 1895—were detained in the fairground’s festival hall, where some were mistreated. Several Jews left the town after the pogrom; several others committed suicide. The synagogue ruins were later torn down. Deportations from Bockenheim—the festival hall was one of several collection points—began in 1941. At least 11 Bockenheim Jews died in the Shoah. In 1986, a photo of the former synagogue was unveiled at the Kirchplatz subway station. Memorials were erected on Schlossstrasse and in the festival hall in November of 1988 and in 1991, respectively.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn Sources: AJ, DGFJ, FJG, GFJ",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=260,260
Bockenheim,16th century,118 in 1853,30,"Although individual Jews settled temporarily in Bockenheim before the early 19th century, it was only then that an actual community began to develop. Local Jews conducted services in a prayer hall (located in a private residence) until 1848, when a small, purpose-built synagogue with seats for 25 men and 20 women was built in Bockenheim. Many members of the diminished community left after the Nazis implemented their anti-Jewish boycott. On Pogrom Night, the few remaining Jews witnessed the destruction of the synagogue’s interior and the desecration of its ritual objects and Torah scrolls. By 1939, all Jews had left the town. The synagogue building, sold and converted into a residence, no longer bears any of its original architectural features.","Harold Slutzkin Sources: LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=261,261

By 1933, the community was known as the joint community of Bodenfelde-Uslar.  At some point in the 18th century, a prayer hall was established in a private residence in Bodenfelde, in which the Jews of Lippoldsberg and Uslar also prayed. The house was sold in 1753, after which services were conducted in Lippoldsberg until 1760, when another prayer room was established in Bodenfelde. Uslar Jews prayed in their own prayer room (it was moved on several occasions) from the 1890s onwards. In Bodenfelde, local Jews established the following institutions: a cemetery in the early 1820s; a synagogue in 1825; a mikveh in 1859 (used until 1890); and an elementary school—it was presided over by a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet—by 1819. Uslar’s elementary school was closed in 1895. In 1933, five schoolchildren from Bodenfelde received religious instruction. A chevra kadisha and a charity fund were active in the community. In June 1937, the authorities ordered that the community be disbanded. The synagogue was sold to a local shoemaker that year, after which the ritual objects were placed in the care of an elderly brother and sister who, because of their poverty and advanced age, could not leave. On Pogrom Night, local residents prevented the SA from burning down the synagogue and the remaining Jewish house; the two elderly Jews were driven out of their home by a mob. Later, in September, 1939, SA men damaged the cemetery. Nine Bodenfelde Jews emigrated and six relocated within Germany. In July 1942, the two elderly Jews were deported to the East; and in December 1938, Uslar’s last Jewish resident, a Jewish woman who had converted to Christianity, left the town. At least 31 Jews from Bodenfelde and Uslar perished in the Shoah. The cemetery was fully restored in 1990; the synagogue building is now a storage site. In 1988, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the site of the former prayer hall.","Nurit Borut Sources: GUVN, PK-NW, SH",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=262,262
Bodersweier,early 1700s,116 in 1875,34,"Local Jews were permitted to open their own shops in 1717, a decision that triggered protests from Christian merchants. The records also tell us that, in 1756, the Jews of Bodersweier requested, and apparently received, permission to establish a prayer room in a private residence. In 1813, a new synagogue was built at 25 Querbacher (renovated in 1833 and 1858). The 34 Jews who lived in Bodersweier in 1933 maintained a synagogue and a community house, the latter of which housed a mikveh (renovated in 1860) and a schoolroom. A teacher from Kehl instructed children in religion, and we also know that burials were conducted in Freistett. The interior of the synagogue and the ritual objects were destroyed during the Pogrom Night of 1938. Eight Jews were arrested that night, taken to Kehl, where they were tortured, and sent to Dachau. Eight local Jews emigrated, eight relocated within Germany, three died in Bodersweier and one committed suicide. In October 1940, 15 Bodersweier Jews were deported to Gurs concentration camp in France; in total, 22 were deported to concentration camps. At least 26 Bodersweier Jews perished during the Shoah. The community house was demolished in 1940/41, and the synagogue was torn down in 1951.

Boedigheim,1345,119 in 1836,14,"During the first half of the 18th century, this community’s junior rabbi worked under the rabbinate in Heidingsfeld. In 1827, Boedigheim was assigned to the Merchingen district rabinate. We also know that the community’s last rabbi, Gedalja Metz, died in 1850. The community inaugurated its first synagogue in 1818; two years after which the decision was made to build a new house of worship. Construction was completed in 1828, and the synagogue was consecrated in 1829 or 1830. The building housed a classroom and living quarters for a teacher who was also the community’s chazzan and shochet. Described as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Mosbach, it was renovated in 1911. The cemetery served over 30 Jewish communities in the region. Salomon Salm was the community leader at the beginning of the Nazi period. On the morning of Pogrom Night, a former policeman broke into the synagogue and smashed the windows and furniture. The ritual objects and Torah scrolls were saved because the congregation had earlier transferred them to the Jewish High Council in Karlsruhe. Later that day, SA broke into homes, destroyed properties and assaulted Jewish residents. Six Jews were deported to Gurs in October, 1940. Only one child survived. At least nine Boedigheim Jews were murdered in the Shoah. The synagogue building served as a residence after the war.

Boechingen,1584,1852 (25% of the total population),45,"Few Jews were permitted to settle in Boechingen before the French conquest of 1797, and only on the condition that they pay “protection money.” It was during the early part of the 19th century that this community of small traders and cattle dealers managed to form a congregation, a Jewish school (1813), a mikveh and a prayer hall. In 1850, when the prayer hall premises were deemed unsafe, a synagogue—the site also accommodated a school building and an apartment for the teacher—was built in Boechingen (70 seats for men, 50 for women). The Jewish teacher also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet; in 1917, Jacob Possenheime was appointed teacher. Many Jews left Boechingen after the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933, so that few Jews were left to witness the destruction of Pogrom Night, when the synagogue and adjoining communal buildings were set on fire.

The synagogue’s location in unknown, but we do know that in December 1840, a new synagogue was established at 43 Schulstrasse, in Boehl. Damaged by fire in 1906, the building was subsequently renovated. Although the Schulstrasse synagogue was rarely used after 1914—services, in fact, were held there mainly on Jewish holidays—the structure was nevertheless renovated in 1920. Burials were conducted in Hassloch. In 1938, only 14 or 15 Jews lived in Boehl-Iggelheim. On Pogrom Night, SA men and members of the Nazi party, accompanied by local residents, systematically destroyed the synagogue’s interior, Torah scrolls, windows, doors and roof tiles. The synagogue also housed an apartment, and although non-Jews were living there on Pogrom Night, it, too, was destroyed. Later, in 1940, the village authorities appropriated the synagogue building, after which it was demolished. Several Jewish families left Boehl-Iggelheim after the pogrom. On October 22, 1940, seven Boehl-Iggelheim Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. Six Boehl-Iggelheim Jews perished in the Shoah.

Unable to gather much in the way of funds, the community purchased a small house and established a synagogue and school in its rooms; a cemetery was situated on one side of the building. Local Jews conducted services in this small synagogue until 1901, when it was destroyed by fire. In the spring of 1903, the community inaugurated a new synagogue on the same site. During the mid-1920s the Jews of Boesingfeld began to experience the consequences of vile anti-Semitic propaganda printed in the local newspapers. Later, on Pogrom Night, Nazi thugs destroyed the interior of the synagogue and set it on fire; Jewish-owned businesses were also vandalized. As the exterior of the synagogue had not been damaged, the building was converted into an apartment building which, in turn, was torn down in 1988 to make way for a new street.

Jews conducted services in a prayer hall, attached to a private residence, until a community member donated a plot of land on which a synagogue with a seating capacity of 100 was built. The Jewish population decreased rapidly after World War I, as local Jews left in hopes of finding better economic opportunities elsewhere. More Jews left the area after the Nazis implemented their anti-Jewish boycott (1933). On Pogrom Night, the synagogue and the remaining Jewish-owned stores and homes were wrecked; the names of local Jewish soldiers who died in World War I were removed from the town’s war memorial. Of those Jews who still lived in Bollendorf on Pogrom Night, some managed to cross the nearby border or otherwise flee. Only 11 Jews lived in the town when the final deportation took place, but at least 23 Bollendorf Jews perished in the Shoah.

Local Jews established a school during the 19th century, and we also know that burials were conducted in Waibstadt. Julius Zion was chairman of the Bonfeld gymnastics club; a rare example of a Jew achieving prominence in a German social or sporting organization. In 1933, the 40 Jews (half would emigrate before 1941) of Bonfeld employed a shochet and maintained a synagogue and mikveh. By 1938, the boycott had forced out most of the village’s Jewish business owners. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA men destroyed the synagogue’s interior and assaulted Jewish men. Hugo Heinrich Hertz suffered internal injuries so severe that he died of them two years later. Several men were sent to Dachau after the pogrom, and the synagogue was sold and demolished a few weeks later.

Bonn,1096,"1,503 in 1905","1,268","The records indicate that Jews settled in Bonn in the early 13th century and established a synagogue on the Judengasse. During the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, the Jews of Bonn were massacred. Beginning in the 1400s, Jews returned to the city and began to rebuild their community, which would become the headquarters of the regional rabbinate. Strong evidence suggests that a synagogue existed in Bonn in 1604. Bonn was destroyed in 1689 by Fredrick III of Brandenburg; later, when the city was rebuilt, Jews carved out a neighborhood along the Rhine and established a new Judengasse there. Years later, the Jewish community established a new synagogue on the Judengasse: For this purpose, two adjoining houses were renovated, combined and converted into a synagogue and rabbi’s residence; the date, 1716, was carved above the door. By 1813, the Jewish community had developed into the largest between the Rhine and Mosel rivers. Local Jews decided to erect a new and larger synagogue (on the same site) when the older structure was no longer able to meet the congregation’s needs. These plans were changed, however, when a wealthy family purchased property on the same street and donated it for the construction of a new house of worship. Inaugurated on January 31, 1879, the synagogue was a magnificent edifice, built with no expense spared. In 1929, in honor of the synagogue’s 50th anniversary, the community undertook a massive renovation project, refurbishing the entire building. The most notable of the improvements was the new Torah Ark, which was enlarged to accommodate the synagogue’s 26 Torah scrolls. The ark, in fact, was the synagogue’s prominent feature. On Pogrom Night, SS hoodlums plundered the synagogue and set it ablaze while the fire department protected the neighboring homes; the fire was so intense that the synagogue burned to the ground. The rubble was removed in early 1939, after which the site became a parking lot. Years later, a hotel was built on the grounds of the destroyed synagogue. A memorial plaque has been unveiled at the site. Bonn’s Orthodox community conducted services in its own large synagogue; it, too, was destroyed on Pogrom Night.","Moshe Finkel Sources: LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=270,270

It was not until the mid-18th century that a lasting Jewish presence was established in the town. The Jews of Boppard had opened a Jewish school by 1356, a cemetery in the 17th century and a new cemetery in the mid-19th century, the last of which was renovated in 1866. We also know that the community’s rented prayer room—it was located in a private residence—was destroyed by fire in 1865, after which, in 1866, a new prayer room suffered the same fate. A synagogue was inaugurated in 1867 and renovated in 1927. In 1933, two chevra kadisha organizations (one for men, the other for women) were active in the community, as were branches of nationwide Jewish organizations. Twenty Jewish children received religious instruction that year. In Boppard, Jews were assaulted on Pogrom Night, and Jewish-owned homes and businesses were wrecked. On the afternoon of November 10, Nazis destroyed the synagogue’s interior and burned its Torah scrolls and furniture. Jewish men were arrested the next day and forced to destroy what remained of the synagogue’s interior furnishings. Ten Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. Most Jews left Boppard before 1941. In April 1942, the town’s remaining 32 Jews were sent to Bad Salzig, from where some were deported to the East (the elderly were sent to Theresienstadt). Two Jews married to Christians remained in Boppard after the initial deportations: one eventually died in Auschwitz in 1943, the other was deported to Theresienstadt in 1944.

The community consecrated its own cemetery in the early 1880s, prior to which burials had been conducted in one of the neighboring Jewish cemeteries. It was not, however, until 1929 that the Borgentreich congregation attained independent status. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s furnishings were plundered and carted off to be burned elsewhere. The building itself was not set on fire, however, for it was located next to several other structures. Sold in the summer of 1939, the synagogue building was then used as a warehouse; and at the end of the 1950s, the structure was torn down in order to widen the street. The following is a passage from the Mayor’s report, dated November 17, 1938: “…The Jews were pitied, especially because of the damage that had been inflicted on their property, and because the Jewish men were taken to a concentration camp.

As a result of an influx of Ostjuden (Jews from Eastern Europe), the Jewish population began to increase, necessitating the construction of a larger synagogue. The congregation considered enlarging the synagogue by using the vacant room next door, but a rift in the community halted proceedings: the original members wanted the synagogue to be reformed, whereas the newer immigrants wanted it to remain Orthodox. Unable to reach an agreement, the two groups split, after which the Orthodox congregants inaugurated their own synagogue and Talmud Torah. By early 1933, anti-Semitism was rampant in Bottrop. The SA organized boycotts of Jewish businesses and forced many to close down, prompting Jews to leave the town; many immigrated to Palestine, Belgium and the Netherlands.

Records from 1769 mention the existence of a prayer room, but we do not know when it was built. The community established a synagogue in 1882, a mikveh (unknown date of construction) and an elementary school in the 1820s. The school was closed down in 1871 as a result of low enrollment numbers, after which the community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Burials were conducted in Soetern. In 1933, 41 Jews lived in Bosen. A charitable society was active in the community, and seven children studied religion. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed. Jewish men were assaulted, and all remaining Jews (including the women) were forced to desecrate the synagogue and, later, to clean up the site. The building was subsequently sold. In April 1942, 23 Bosen Jews were deported to the East. At least 23 Jews originally from Bosen perished in the Shoah. The synagogue is now an apartment house. Two memorial monuments have been erected in Bosen, one at the former mikveh site.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, DGJS, EJL, FJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=279,279
Brandenburg/Havel,14th century,483 in 1925,200,"The earliest available reference to a Brandenburg Jew is dated 1313. The town was home to a synagogue as early as 1322, but its location is not known. Although Jews were expelled from Brandenburg/Havel after the Black Death persecutions of 1348, they established a new presence there in 1372. By 1490, the town was home to a Judengasse (probably presentday Lindenstrasse); records from the late 15th century also mention a Jewish cemetery. Jews were expelled from the town yet again in 1573, and it was not until 1671 that the forefathers of the modern community moved to Brandenburg. In order to accommodate the growing population, the community built two synagogues—one in 1781, the other in 1883; the latter, located on 15 Grosse Muenzenstrasse, was renovated in 1903. Although the community had maintained a Jewish cemetery before 1720, a second one was consecrated in 1747. A rabbi and chazzan were hired in 1859, and we also know that local Jews were served by a shochet, a teacher of religion and a servant, the last of which, together with his wife, cared for the sick and dying. Brandenburg was also home to a mikveh. By the end of the 19th century, Brandenburg Jews were involved in a wide array of professions; many were merchants, but others worked as dentists, lawyers and chemists. On Pogrom Night, SA men burned down the synagogue. The cemetery was desecrated, and the mortuary (built in 1770) torn down. Jewish-owned stores were damaged and looted, and Jews were assaulted, one of whom, a woman, committed suicide. Ninety Jews were deported to the East in the early 1940s; twenty-eight were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto in April 1942. Ten Jews, presumably protected by marriages to Gentiles, survived the war in Brandenburg. A memorial plaque was later affixed to the wall of the destroyed synagogue on Grosse Muenzenstrasse.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: AJ, EJL, SIA, WDJB",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=282,282
Brandoberndorf,1757,25-28 in 1932/33,,"The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Brandoberndorf (in the Usingen district) is dated 1757. In 1834, after a new synagogue was inaugurated in Cleeberg, the district authorities tried, in vain, to persuade Brandoberndorf Jews to pray there. Instead, local Jews conducted services in a half-timbered house in neighboring Kroeffelbach; the building, located at 102 Lindenstrasse, was converted into a proper synagogue in 1876. It was in Kroeffelbach, too, that the community maintained a cemetery. Between 25 and 28 Jews lived in Brandoberndorf in 1933, by which point the Jews of Kraftsolm had begun to attend services in the Kroeffelbach synagogue. The synagogue was burned to the ground on Pogrom Night, after which the site was leveled. According to Yad Vashem, 13 Brandoberndorf Jews perished in the Shoah. As of this writing, a memorial has never been erected in the town.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=283,283
Brauneberg,18th century,1870-1880 (see below),20 (see below),"Jewish life in what was then the village of Dusemond began in the 18th century (Dusemond changed its name to Brauneberg in 1925). A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1870. Religious services were conducted in a prayer hall until the second half of the 19th century, when the community established a synagogue at 145 Moselweinstrasse (previously 75 Hauptstrasse). In 1896, the Jews of Muelheim an der Mosel, Veldenz, Lieser and Wintrich were affiliated with the Brauneberg community. Brauneberg’s synagogue was desecrated in 1900. In 1933, 20 Jews lived in Brauneberg. The community, however, counted 62 members, for, as mentioned above, several neighboring Jewish communities were affiliated with Brauneberg. We also know that the community employed a shochet and a chazzan that year, and that two chevra kadisha organizations—one for men, the other for women—and a welfare association were active in Brauneberg. In 1937, local Jews joined the community of Neumager- Niederemmel, at which point religious services in Brauneberg’s synagogue probably ceased. On Pogrom Night, SA men broke into and wrecked the Brauneberg synagogue. Later, in October 1941, Brauneberg’s remaining Jews were deported. At least 14 Brauneberg Jews perished in the Shoah, as did 10 from Veldenz. After 1945, the old synagogue building was converted into a barn. Renovated in the 1990s (the façade was recreated in the synagogue’s original style), the building now serves as a café and restaurant.

Braunfels,1500,79 in 1843,26,"Jews were not permitted to live in Braunfels until the late 1600s. They had no synagogue, and traveled to nearby Leun (which was home to the oldest synagogue in the region) for services. As Leun was at a considerable distance from Braunfels, and unsafe to travel to during periods of war or social instability, the Jews of Braunfels decided to establish their own community and synagogue. In 1697, they converted a private residence into a synagogue; services were conducted there until 1850, when the community purchased a barn and converted it into a new house of worship for Braunfels and the surrounding villages. Most of the town’s Jews immigrated to the United States during the early years of the Nazi regime, so that only 19 Jews still lived there in 1938. The Jewish community was accordingly dissolved. On Pogrom Night, rioters ravaged the synagogue’s interior and looted its furnishings. The building was torn down in 1951. In 1980 a memorial plaque, commemorating the Jews of Braunfels, was unveiled at the synagogue site.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=285,285
Braunsbach,1606,"2,893 in 1843",39,"The Jews of Braunsbach established a prayer room at the end of the 1600s, a synagogue in 1732 and a cemetery in 1738. Between 1832 and 1913, a district rabbinate housing a school and living quarters for the local rabbi was based at 8 Im Rabbinat. Rabbi Menko Berlinger and Dr. Jacob Berlinger, both of the famous Berlinger family, served as rabbis. The rabbinate moved to Schwaebisch-Hall in 1914, but the building continued to function intermittently as a school. In 1933, a poster campaign denouncing any Gentile who associated with Jews as a Judenfreund, or “Jew-friend,” was launched in Braunsbach. Later, on Pogrom Night, SA men from Schwaebisch-Hall wrecked the synagogue’s interior. Seventeen local Jews emigrated from Germany. The remaining Jews were deported to Riga, Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, where nearly all died. According to Yad Vashem, 35 Braunsbach Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue, mikveh and rabbinate have been preserved to some degree; in fact, Braunsbach is thought to be the only place in Germany where this happened. The synagogue’s ruins were integrated into a festival and sports complex called the Burgenlandhalle. In 1978, a Jewish man living in Switzerland donated a plaque to mark the synagogue’s location; the plaque was moved to the entrance of the Rosenstein hall (part of the Burgenlandhalle) in 1984.

In 1855, in response to growing population numbers, the community erected a synagogue on Fleischerstrasse. Local Jews also maintained a cemetery on Bahnhofstrasse. Jews and Gentiles coexisted peacefully in Braunsberg. A prominent Jewish dentist from nearby Koenigsberg, who was very active in Braunsberg, received honorary citizenship in appreciation of his work. Of the 80 Jews living in Braunsberg when the Nazis rose to power, most had left by 1939. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was set on fire and the cemetery desecrated, after which the few remaining Jews were forced to abandon their homes and businesses.

Braunschweig,1296,939 in 1925,682,"The 14th-century Jewish community of Braunschweig had to contend with two disasters: the Black Death pandemic—50 percent of the community died from the disease—and the ensuing anti-Jewish massacres. A local duke, however, managed to protect a number of Braunschweig Jews from the slaughter. Although we do not know much about the fate of Jewish Braunschweig during the next few centuries, we can trace the emergence of the modern community to the beginning of the 18th century, when the town council remitted the poll tax and appointed a Jew, one Alexander David, as crown agent. Between 1750 and 1760, 12-15 Jewish families moved to Braunschweig. Jews conducted services in a prayer hall, located in David’s home, until the owner’s death in 1765, after which the congregation prayed in a purposebuilt synagogue. Rabbi Levi Eger (1768-1842) introduced Braunschweig Jews to Reform Judaism, and in 1875 the increasingly prosperous community built an impressive synagogue which incorporated both Oriental and Gothic architectural features. As was the case in other professional, middle-class Jewish communities, social activities and organizations abounded in Braunschweig. A cultural and historical society was active in the community, as were a women’s guild, a youth club and the Bar Kochba sports club. Beginning in 1933, right after the Nazis implemented the anti-Jewish boycott, Braunschweig Jews began to leave the community; by 1941, 437 had emigrated from Germany. Large Jewish-owned businesses were Aryanized in 1938, the same year in which Braunschweig Jews of Polish background were deported to Poland. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was vandalized and Jewish men were arrested. Of the 49 Jews, the town’s last, who were later deported, few survived. After the war, a group of Braunschweig Jews and displaced persons returned to Braunschweig and, with the help of the Jewish Overseas Aid Committee, reestablished the community. Ownership of the community house was transferred to the Jewish Trust Committee. Memorial plaques were unveiled at the cemeteries in 1960; that same year, City Hall recorded the wartime memories of Jewish survivors from Braunschweig. A synagogue was later established inside the former community house; by 2001, it had 160 members. In 2006, a new synagogue, designed by architect Klaus Zugermeyer, was inaugurated in Braunschweig.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: HNB, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=289,289
Breisach,unknown,572 in 1839,231,"The history of Jewish Breisach began in the Middle Ages. As a result of ongoing persecution and a series of expulsions, a lasting community was not founded there until 1638. The Jewish population peaked at 572 members in 1839. The community consecrated a cemetery in the 16th century. The first synagogue was destroyed by fire in 1793, after which, in 1804, the community built a new house of worship. Established in Breisach in 1827, the district rabbinate was transferred to Freiburg in 1885. During the 1830s, local Jews built a larger synagogue (it housed a mikveh) and consecrated a second cemetery. We also know that the new synagogue was enlarged between 1870 and 1875, and that, between 1835 and 1876, the community maintained a Jewish school in a former inn. Jewish associations included a chevra kadisha for men (founded in 1838), one for women (founded in 1832) and a women’s association. In 1933, 231 Jews lived in Breisach. The Jewish school reopened briefly from 1938 to 1940. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, when 30 Breisach Jews were arrested and transported to Dachau. Michael Eisemann, the community’s chazzan and Hebrew teacher, died in a Freiburg hospital in February of the following year; he had been sent there, severely emaciated, from Dachau. Thirty-four local Jews were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. The Jewish wife of a Christian stayed behind, as did a mentally ill woman who was eventually murdered at the Grafeneck Institute as part of the Nazis’ euthanasia program. At least 68 Breisach Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial stone was unveiled at the site of the former synagogue in 1959; and in 1998, a full-scale memorial was erected in the town.

Bremen,14th century (see below),"1,813 in 1910","1,314","We know very little about the lives of Jews in Bremen before the 14th century; however, beginning in that century, records increasingly refer to a Jewish presence in the city. In 1802, Bremen annexed Hastedt, home to an unspecified number of “protected” Jews, as well as a Jewish cemetery at 1796 Deichbruchstrasse. In 1803, when the Jews of Bremen founded their own community, the Hastedt cemetery became Bremen’s official Jewish burial site (enlarged in 1909). In Bremen, Jews were granted civil rights in March 1849, after which the Jewish population increased and religious life flourished. Services were conducted in rented prayer rooms until 1876, when a synagogue was inaugurated at 6 Gartenstrasse (present-day Kolpingstrasse). Leopold Rosenak, an Orthodox rabbi, was hired in 1896 and served the community for 27 years. Local Jews also maintained a mikveh (on Vohnenstrasse), a school for religious studies (on Grosse Johannisstrasse) and, beginning in 1922, an old-age home on Groepelinger Heerstrasse. In 1927, a community center—it was called Rosenak House—was opened at 7 Gartenstrasse; the center accommodated a teachers’ library, classrooms and offices. In or around 1910, Eastern European Jews founded the Bet HaMidrash Schomre Schabbos (“House of Learning of the Shabbat Observant”), on Sebaldsbruecker Heerstrasse. In June 1933, 1,314 Jews lived in Bremen. Several welfare organizations were active in the community, as were branches of nationwide organizations, Jewish foundations, cultural associations, sports clubs and youth groups. In 1932/33, 115 schoolchildren studied religion under the guidance of a rabbi. We also know that on September 30 that year, six SA men entered the synagogue at night and stole books and documents. On Pogrom Night, at some point after midnight, local SA members set the synagogue on fire. The Rosenak House was looted and damaged, Jewish shops and homes were destroyed and the Bet HaMidrash and the Jewish old-age home were attacked. One Jew committed suicide, two were murdered and many were arrested and detained in the schoolyard. The following day, more than 160 Jewish men were sent to the jail in Bremen-Oslebshausen; they were later deported to Sachsenhausen and interned there until December 1938. Bremen’s Jewish cemetery was desecrated on the afternoon of November 10, 1938. After the destruction of the synagogue, services were moved to the school on 6 Kohlhoekerstrasse. Between 1933 and 1941, roughly 930 local Jews emigrated. In 1941, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved to so-called “Jews’ Houses.” Approximately 650 Bremen Jews were deported in 1941, 1942 and 1945. According to records, 165 Bremen Jews worked as forced laborers in Bremen-Farge in 1944. At least 849 Bremen Jews perished in the Shoah. The Jewish community, reestablished in August 1945, conducted services in a private residence at Osterdeich until August 1961, when a synagogue was inaugurated at 117 Schwachhauser Heerstrasse. Bremen’s Jewish cemetery was declared an historic site in 1978. Numerous memorial plaques and stones have been unveiled in Bremen since 1982—at, among other locations, Kolpinghaus, Landherrnamt, Am Barkhof High School, the Jewish old-age home in Groepelingen, and the new synagogue.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn Sources: EJL, FGJ, JGNB1, SIA, YV friedhof-bremen.jimdo.com www.rosenak-haus.de www.denktag.de",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=291,291
Bremke,1727,159 in 1852 (16.7% of the total population),26,"The Jews of Gelliehausen and Woellmarshausen were affiliated with the Jewish community of Bremke in 1853 and 1877, respectively. In 1828, a Gentile resident of Bremke built a synagogue on his property (42 Heiligenstaedterstrasse); the Jewish community financed the construction and afterwards paid monthly rent. A mikveh was built in another rented building in 1845, by which point Bremke was home to a Jewish elementary school whose teacher performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. After the school closed in 1914, children studied religion with a teacher from Heiligenstatd and later with one from Goettingen. We also know that the Jews of Bremke established two cemeteries—one in the 18th century (enlarged in 1800), the other in 1844. (There was also a cemetery in Woellmarshausen.) Eleven schoolchildren received religious instruction in 1933. Nazis repeatedly attacked the synagogue, in response to which, in 1934, services were moved to a private residence. Jewish-owned businesses were plundered in 1937. On Pogrom Night, Jewish-owned stores were looted and destroyed; the synagogue and its ritual objects were burned. Later, in the fall of 1939, Bremke’s last six Jews left the area, as did the remaining four Jews in Gelliehausen. At least 22 Bremke Jews and seven from Gelliehausen perished in the Shoah.

Breslau - Introduction,13th century,"23,240 in 1925","20,202","The Middle Ages An extant tombstone, dated 1203, indicates that Jews may have settled here as early as the 12th century. The city’s first medieval Jewish community maintained two synagogues and lived on a Judengasse. Although Silesian dukes encouraged Jews to settle in Breslau, anti-Jewish attitudes were common among church leaders and officials, resulting in the disbanding of the Jewish community shortly after 1347. Breslau was home to another short-lived Jewish community between 1350 and 1360, and yet another from the late 1300s to 1453, when 41 local Jews were burned at the stake and the others expelled. The 17th and 18th Centuries Jewish merchants, who played a significant role in import trade, traveled to Breslau for its fairs and holiday markets. Beginning in 1630, Ferdinand II granted residency rights to a number of Jewish families, enabling them to settle on the city’s outskirts. Many of these Jewish arrivals were traders (of silver, for example). Jews congregated for worship according to their place of origin, e.g., Zuelz, Glogau, or Lemberg, and set up culturally appropriate prayer rooms, or so-called shuls, of which the two oldest were the Lissa Shul (~1685) and the Landshul. Wealthy families established several private prayer halls, so that in 1701 the city was home to 10 places of worship. A chevra kadisha was founded in 1726, but the various congregations had not yet established an official community. This changed in 1744, when Frederick the Great issued an edict permitting the establishment of an official Jewish community, after which Benedict Reuben Gomperz (Baruch Wesel) was appointed state and local rabbi. A Jewish cemetery (1760- 1856) was consecrated on Claasenstrasse in 1760. Nearly a century later, in 1856, a new cemetery was consecrated on Lohestrasse, where Heinrich Graetz, Ferdinand Cohn, Gedalya Titkin, and Edith Stein’s parents were later buried. Another cemetery was consecrated in Cosel in 1902. In Breslau, it was mainly the wealthier families who supported the Jewish Enlightenment, setting up a Jewish school on Wilhelmsschule (1791-1848) where children studied the humanities and, in 1801, an industrial school (Industrieschule) for girls. In or around 1800, Breslau’s Liberal Jews formed the Zum Tempel synagogue association, in which sermons were conducted in German. Later, in the 19th century, disputes erupted between Liberal and Orthodox members; in 1854, the two sides reached a compromise, resulting in the creation of a “united community” that would serve as a model for other Jewish communities in Germany. The 19th century until the Rise of Hitler Following the edict of Jewish emancipation in 1812, Jews began to branch out into areas of social and professional life that had previously been closed to them. They joined political parties, and even served on the municipal council, the national assembly and the Reichstag (parliament); Ferdinand Lassalle (1825-1864), Paula Ollendorff (1860- 1938) and Eugen Schiffer (1860-1954) were actively engaged in politics. Aided by generous philanthropists, two of whom were David Fraenckel and Julius Schottlaender, the community was also able to establish many new social and educational organizations. These included a new Jewish hospital, a shelter, an orphanage, several charitable foundations and the Jewish Theological Seminary (1854- 1939), the first modern rabbinical seminary in Central Europe. In 1829, after receiving permission from the government to build a synagogue, the community inaugurated the Storchsynagoge, which initially served liberal Jews. In 1872, when Breslau’s Liberal congregation inaugurated the Neue Synagoge—the second largest in pre-war Germany—under the guidance of Abraham Geiger’s successor, Rabbi Manuel Joel, the Storchsynagoge became the religious center for those who adhered to the Modern Orthodox tradition. From 1810 until 1925, the Jewish population grew from approximately 3,000 to a peak of 23,240—the third largest Jewish community in Germany. The Nazi Era Anti-Semitism intensified in Breslau in the late 19th century, with its proponents gaining a foothold among students, teachers and medical doctors. In 1923, Jewish-owned stores were looted, the cemetery desecrated, and in 1926 local Jews were accused of blood libel. In 1933, 20,202 Jews lived in Breslau, served by four ritual slaughterers, a mikveh, a hospital, an orphanage, a kindergarten, a library, the above-mentioned seminary and an old-age home. Also active in the community were local branches of national Jewish organizations and various burial, educational, welfare and cultural associations. In 1932/33, 1,650 schoolchildren received religious instruction at Jewish secondary schools and schools for religious studies. We also know that, in 1934, a local branch of the Jewish Cultural Association was opened in Breslau. Zionist groups increasingly attracted younger Jews, in response to which the community offered vocational training courses to prepare the youth for life in Palestine. In Breslau, anti-Jewish boycotts occurred even before the official boycott of April 1933. Jurists, doctors, professors and teachers were dismissed from their posts, and local Jews were beaten, tortured, imprisoned and killed by Nazis. In October 1938, Polish Jews were expelled from Breslau. On Pogrom Night, Nazis vandalized most of Breslau’s prayer rooms, completely destroying the Neue Synagoge. Jews were killed on the streets; property and shops were destroyed. Approximately 2,500 local Jewish men were arrested, most of whom were sent to Buchenwald. The Storchsynagoge was also damaged during Pogrom Night, but Liberal and Orthodox Jews continued to conduct services there until 1941. Services also continued at the Israelite Hospital, the Beate-Guttmann Home and the Rehdiger School. In August 1939, the confiscation of Jewish community buildings began in earnest. Jews were seized for forced labor, and between 1939 and 1941 more than 600 left Breslau. In September 1941, the remaining Jews were moved into designated “Jewish houses.” Deportations left Breslau from June/July of 1941 until early 1945. Between 1,500 and 1,800 Jews were initially sent, in a total of three transports, to the nearby camps, from which they were deported to the East and to Theresienstadt. Only 150 Jews remained in Breslau in 1945. After the Second World War After the war, when the city became Polish, approximately 10,000 Eastern European refugees settled there. The new community (8,000 in 1962) conducted services at the Storchsynagoge. Most Jews later left Breslau—mainly for Scandinavia, Israel and elsewhere—as a result of the communist government’s anti-Jewish policies. The Storchsynagoge was restored and reopened in May 2010. A plaque has been affixed to the building, informing passersby that Jews had been rounded for deportation there. As of this writing, the site of the Neue Synagoge serves the city as a school playground; there, too, a memorial stone was unveiled. In 1988, the old Jewish cemetery (1856) was opened to the public as the Museum of Cemetery Architecture. Breslau’s Jewish community is the largest in Poland.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: BJ, EJL, FJG, IAJGS, JWD, LBIYB41, MJLFB www.ajr.org.uk/journal/issue.Aug07/article.894",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=293,293
Bretten,1264,265 in 1895,114,"In Bretten, it was not until after the Thirty Years’ War that a lasting Jewish community began to develop. In 1827, a district rabbinate was established in the village.

Bretten’s Jewish population actually increased after the Nazis’ rise to power. On Pogrom Night, the community center, Jewish-owned businesses and the synagogue were destroyed. The synagogue was set on fire: 25 Torah scrolls, together with other ritual objects, went up in flames. At noon the following day, members of the SA and SS paraded Jewish men through town before forcing them to stand in front of the synagogue and listen to a racist tirade. All Jewish men under 60 were sent to Dachau. Between 1937 and 1940, at least 76 local Jews emigrated; 36 moved to other German cities. Eighteen Jews, the town’s last, were eventually deported to Gurs, France. At least 23 Bretten Jews perished in the Shoah.

Bretzenheim,1517,84 in 1861,26,"Although we do not know how many Jews lived in Bretzenheim in the 16th century, records do tell us that they had established a synagogue by 1580. In 1742, the community conducted services in a prayer hall, located in a private residence, which was presumably used until the establishment, in 1788, of a synagogue on the corner of Wilhelmstrasse and Oberpforte (a mikveh was installed there a few years later). The synagogue was destroyed in the war of 1795, after which the congregation conducted services in a private residence until the 1810s, when a new house of worship was inaugurated on its predecessor’s site; later, in 1912, the seating capacity was increased from 34 to over 50. Beginning in 1883, the Jews of Bretzenheim maintained their own cemetery; and in 1912, a new cemetery was consecrated inside the municipal graveyard. We also know that the community employed a teacher of religion—he performed the duties of chazzan and shochet—until World War I. In 1933, one Jewish child received religious instruction. On Pogrom Night, rioters vandalized the synagogue’s interior and incinerated the Torah scrolls. In Finthen (an affiliated community), Jewish homes and property were heavily damaged. The synagogue was sold into private ownership in 1939. Five Jewish families from Bretzenheim emigrated (four went to the United States). In March 1942, 17 local Jews were deported to Poland. At least eight Bretzenheim Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue—it was heavily damaged during a wartime aerial bombing—was demolished in 1946. A memorial plaque has been erected in Bretzenheim.","Heike Zaun Goshen Sources: AJ, EJL, FJG, PK-HNF",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=301,301
Brauna,1744,43 in 1861,13,"Breuna was home to a Jewish school in 1867, and it is likely that the building housed a prayer room. The community inaugurated a small synagogue on Lange Strasse in 1876; in 1925/26, the synagogue was enlarged to accommodate 50 men and 20 women. Until the late 1920s, the community employed teachers of religion who also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers. We also know that the Jews of Breuna maintained a mikveh and, from the 18th century (possibly earlier) onwards, one of the largest regional cemeteries in Hessen. In 1933, 13 Jews lived in Breuna. The Jews of Niederelsungen, Oberlistingen and Wettesingen were affiliated with the community. According to the records, 17 Jews lived in Breuna in 1937. Although the synagogue had been sold in August 1938, the SA set it on fire on Pogrom Night; the interior and roof were destroyed, but the exterior walls remained intact. Later, in 1939, the synagogue was converted into a barn. Three Jews emigrated, two relocated within Germany and two died in Breuna. Breuna’s last Jewish family (six members) was deported to the East in May 1942. At least 16 Jewish residents of Breuna, 11 from Niederelsungen, nine from Oberlistingen and one from Wettesingen perished in the Shoah. In 1988, a memorial plaque was affixed to the renovated synagogue building.

Breyell,mid-19th century,44 in 1905,26,"In 1899, the 18 Jews of Breyell formed a synagogue association in cooperation with Jews from neighboring towns. Breyell’s Jewish population steadily increased (44 in 1905), in response to which the community inaugurated a new synagogue on October 21, 1910. Very little is known about this small Jewish community. An extant photograph of the synagogue, however, shows an ornate, neo-Romanesque building with many bow-shaped windows. According to a report issued in connection to the War Reparation Act of 1952, the Breyell synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night. Records suggest that Jakob Klaber, a cattle trader, purchased the synagogue site, after which, faced with the expense of removing the rubble, he sold the site to the Breyell municipality for 300 Reichsmarks. The War Reparation report also states that 26 local Jews (the entire Jewish population of 1933) perished in the Shoah. As of this writing, no memorial has been erected in Breyell.","Moshe Finkel Sources: EJL, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=303,303
Brodenbach,unknown,53 in 1895,18,"Although it is likely that Jews lived in Brodenbach during the Middle Ages, the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement was first documented in 1808. A private synagogue, established in a residence in the early 19th century, became community property in 1851. The synagogue building contained a prayer room (located on the upper floor) with separate rooms for men and women; worshippers had to make their way through the butcher’s shop below to gain access to the synagogue. Burials were conducted in a cemetery jointly owned by the Brodenbach and Oberfell Jewish communities. Eighteen Jews lived in Brodenbach in 1933. The community, however, numbered 24 members, as six Jews from the surrounding towns and villages, one of which was Oberfell, attended services in Brodenbach. On Pogrom Night, SA men and local Nazis forced their way into the butcher’s shop below the synagogue. Frustrated to find the synagogue’s door locked, they smeared the building with anti-Semitic graffiti. The next morning, a mob armed with axes and clubs broke down the door and destroyed the synagogue’s interior. A neighboring resident managed to rescue the synagogue’s Torah scrolls and prayer books, after which she handed them over to the Christian minister of nearby Alken for safekeeping. In April 1942, seventeen Jews, Brodenbach’s last, were deported to the East. At least 12 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue building was demolished in either 1953 or 1960.","Bronagh Bowerman Sources: EJL, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=305,305
Brilon,1578,131 in 1864,72,"Although evidence indicates that Jews lived in Brilon as early as 1578, it was not until the mid-1600s that an official Jewish community developed there. In 1712, the community designated a prayer room; later, in 1741, it was inaugurated as a synagogue. Yosef Avraham Freidland, who in 1832 was appointed state rabbi of Westphalia, set up his official headquarters in Brilon. On May 10, 1931—construction commenced in 1929—the community inaugurated a new synagogue on Hubertusstrasse. The synagogue was vandalized on several occasions before Pogrom Night, in response to which the community replaced the windows with reinforced glass. On Pogrom Night, rioters smashed the synagogue’s windows, ransacked the main sanctuary and set the building on fire; the building burned to the ground. Those Jews who still lived in Brilon in 1939 either emigrated from or relocated within Germany. In 1942, the remaining local Jews were deported. Cleared in 1939, the synagogue site is now an open area. A memorial plaque was unveiled there in 1983.","Moshe Finkel Sources: EJL, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=304,304
Brotdorf,early 18th century,75 in 1895,unknown (26 in 1932),"In 1868, the Jewish community of Brotdorf joined the Merzig regional community. As a sub-community (Fillialgemeinde), Brotdorf kept its own institutions. Burials, however, were conducted in Merzig. Jews attended synagogue services in Merzig until the first half of the 19th century, when a prayer hall, located in a private residence, was opened in Brotdorf. Brotdorf Jews maintained a mikveh (unknown date of construction) and, beginning in 1854, a synagogue on 52-54 Hausbacher Strasse. During the 19th century, the community employed a teacher of religion who also served as chazzan and shochet. Jewish population figures for 1932 and 1935 were 26 and 31, respectively. After the Saarland was returned to the German Reich in March 1935, many Jews left Brotdorf. By 1938, the Jewish population was 12. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, after which the building was set on fire; Jewish homes were wrecked that night. Later, in 1939, the municipality bought the synagogue site. Six Jews, Brotdorf’s last, were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 15 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue ruins—most of which were destroyed in a wartime bombing raid (1944)—were demolished after the war. A memorial stone, unveiled on the corner of Hausbach Strasse and Helenstrasse in 1984, commemorates the destroyed synagogue.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=306,306
Bruchsal,1288,752 in 1885,501,"Although Bruchsal’s documented Jewish history began in 1288, it was not until after the Thirty Years’ War that Jews began to flourish there. Bruchsal’s original prayer room was located in the home of Jacob Suessel, a community leader from 1704 until 1750. During the Nazi period, it was considered the oldest prayer room in Baden. The community established a synagogue in 1802, a district rabbinate in 1827 and a new synagogue, with an organ, in 1881. Jews not only owned many businesses and helped found Bruchsal’s museum and library, but were also heavily involved in the tobacco and hops industries. The Baer-Oppenheimer family was a force in the textile industry. In 1933, Bruchsal’s 501 Jews maintained a cemetery, a mikveh and seven charity and welfare associations. Jewishowned businesses continued to support the local economy. In 1936, Bruchsal’s 40 Jewish schoolchildren were segregated from their Christian peers. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down, Jewish homes and businesses were attacked, windows were smashed, and furniture and merchandise were either damaged or looted; in Bruchsal, Jewish men were arrested that night and sent to Dachau. The synagogue’s ruins were later dismantled at the Jewish community’s expense. Seventy-six Bruchsal Jews emigrated, 30 relocated within Germany and one committed suicide in August 1938. On October 22, 1940, the last 79 Jews were deported to Gurs. Only four Jewish women, all of whom were married to Christians, remained in Bruchsal. At least 93 local Jews perished in the Shoah. A fire station was built on the former synagogue site (78 Friedrichtstrasse) in the 1950s. A plaque was unveiled there in 1966, followed by another in October 2000.

Bruehl,1177,168 in 1911,101,"In 1853, the Jews of Bruehl were recognized as a semiindependent Jewish community within the regional community of Frechen. The independent Jewish community of Bruehl was founded in 1874. Records from 1371 mention a Jewish cemetery, and we also know that the town was home to prayer halls (in private residences) in 1425 and in 1450. The modern community established a synagogue—it seated 150 worshipers—in 1882 and an elementary school in, at the latest, the 1820s. The school closed in the 1830s, after which the community employed a teacher of religion who also served as chazzan and shochet; beginning in the 1920s, religious instruction was provided by teachers from Cologne. In 1933, 12 schoolchildren studied religion in Bruehl. A women’s association and a chevra kadisha were active in the community, with which the 11 Jews of Pingsdorf were affiliated. Bruehl’s synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, and property and furniture in Jewish businesses and homes were destroyed. Several Jews were beaten, and all men under the age of 60 were arrested and forced to board up broken windows, after Dachau. In 1939, the synagogue site was sold to a local resident who cleared the ruins. Local Jews were used as forced laborers beginning in 1939. Later, in 1941, the remaining Jews were moved into three so-called “Jews’ houses.” More than 50 Jews moved to Bruehl after 1933. Twentyone local Jews emigrated, 81 relocated within Germany and four passed away in Bruehl. In 1942, 22 Jews were deported, via Cologne, to the East; and in 1944, local Jews who were married to Christians were deported to Theresienstadt. At least 69 Bruehl Jews perished in the Shoah.

Bublitz,1728,unknown,32,"The first Jew to settle in Bublitz (present-day Bobolice, Poland) was Michel Fischel, head of a family of seven. Although only three Jewish families lived in Bublitz in the second half of the 18th century, the non-Jewish population unsuccessfully petitioned the authorities, in 1785, to prohibit Jews from selling certain goods. It was during the 19th century that the growing community established its institutions: a synagogue (on Schulstrasse) at some point between 1830 and 1840, and a cemetery (near Gaerwalder Strasse) in the late 19th century. A community functionary performed the duties of cantor, teacher, and head of religious ceremonies. In 1881, as anti-Semitic riots erupted in Pomerania, Jewish-owned homes and the synagogue were damaged in Bublitz. Many Jews accordingly left, and during the early 20th century the Jewish population decreased by 50 percent. During Pogrom Night, on November 10, 1938, the synagogue was destroyed, soon after which the cemetery was closed. A cinema was later erected on the former synagogue’s site. Approximately 50 Jews born in Bublitz perished in concentration camps.","Ruth Martina Trucks Sources: EJL, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=309,309
Buchen,1337,150 in 1862,38,"The Jewish community of Buchen was formed after the pogroms of 1348/49. The first synagogue, inaugurated in 1700, burned down in 1861, after which (in 1864) local Jews inaugurated a new synagogue with a mikveh and an elementary school. In 1889, however, disaster struck again when another fire inflicted major damage on the building and Torah scrolls. We also know that the cemetery at Buchen- Bodingen served Buchen and the surrounding Jewish communities, and that local Jews employed a teacher and maintained several associations. Although the synagogue had been sold in the summer of 1938, the Nazis still destroyed its interior on Pogrom Night. The scrolls were spared, having been transferred to Karlsruhe beforehand. Of the 38 Jews still living in Buchen in 1933, eight emigrated, 13 relocated within Germany, three died of natural causes, one committed suicide, five were deported to Gurs from elsewhere and 10 were sent to Gurs from Buchen (in October, 1940). At least 18 Buchen Jews perished in the Shoah. After the war, the synagogue housed refugee families. In 1951, the building was converted into an apartment. A plaque was unveiled there in 1983; and in 2006 a memorial square was named after Jacob Mayer, a poet and community leader who committed suicide in 1939.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: AJ, SG-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=310,310
Buedesheim,mid-1500s,161 in 1910,57,"Jews lived in Buedesheim from 1720 until 1942. In 1865, a plot of land was purchased near the town hall for the construction of a synagogue, a community center and a mikveh. Construction of this complex commenced in 1866 and was completed in 1871. Local Jews characterized their relationship with Gentile neighbors as “good” and “normal.” This amiable atmosphere of coexistence ended in 1933, when the dire political situation forced many local Jews to leave for North and South America. On Pogrom Night, the remaining Jews watched helplessly as former neighbors broke into Jewish homes, smashed windows and vandalized Jewish-owned businesses. The synagogue was burned down and, in 1941, demolished to make room for a new building. In 1942, all of the town’s remaining Jews were deported to concentration camps. Shortly afterwards, SS troops desecrated the cemetery, hauled off the tombstones and sold them for reuse. Nineteen tombstones were spared. A memorial plaque was later unveiled at the entrance to the Jewish cemetery.","Moshe Finkel Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=311,311
Bueckeburg,17th century,110 in 1913,approximately 60,"In 1913, when the community recorded its peak membership figure, most Bueckeburg Jews were cattle traders, merchants and moneylenders; later, some local Jews entered the banking sector. Bueckeburg was home to a Jewish girls’ boarding school. The earliest available record of the Am Harrel cemetery is dated 1793. Religious services were conducted in prayer rooms until the end of the 18th century, when a synagogue was established on Lange Strasse; in 1866, a new synagogue was built on Bahnhofstrasse. Bueckeburg’s Jewish school, established in the late 17th century, was presided over by a teacher who, at times, performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. We also know that the community maintained a choir, a chevra kadisha, a Jewish women’s association and, beginning in 1934, a youth movement. Although Jews were not heavily involved in local politics and social life, the records do tell us that one served on the fire brigade. As a result of dwindling membership numbers, the community was disbanded in 1931. Later, on Pogrom Night, Jewish-owned business and homes were vandalized, the synagogue’s interior was set on fire and destroyed (the structure survived the blaze) and two Jewish men were deported to Buchenwald. In 1939, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into a few designated houses, including the synagogue. Twenty Bueckeburg Jews emigrated. In 1941 and 1942, most of the remaining Jews were sent to concentration camps; the last were deported in 1944 and 1945. At least 37 Bueckeburg Jews died in the Shoah.

We also know that the community maintained a mikveh and, in the 19th century, employed a teacher of religion who functioned as chazzan and shochet. Later, religious instruction was provided by a teacher from Heldenbergen. Five Jewish children studied religion with the Heldenbergen teacher in 1933. In 1936, windows were smashed in three Jewish homes; and in 1937, an explosive was detonated inside the premises of a Jewish-owned business.

Buende was home to a Jewish school until 1895, and we also know that Jews were active in local politics. On Pogrom Night, with the help of the fire department, the synagogue was destroyed and the cemetery desecrated.

Later, during the 19th century, many Jews from impoverished West Prussia settled in Buetow and established a sizable congregation. The town was situated next to the border, therefore trade with Jews on the Polish side flourished. In 1856, the community consecrated a synagogue on Synagogenstrasse (later renamed Muehlenstrasse), next to the old post office. Despite its considerable size, the congregation did not have its own rabbi, employing instead an official who served as teacher, cantor and head of religious ceremonies. Local Jews maintained a cemetery on Lazaretstrasse. Toward the end of the 19th century, Jews made up 10% of Buetow’s total population. A charitable sisterhood and a literary club were active in the community.

We also know that the synagogue housed a classroom for the elementary school (operated 1859-1924), that the building was renovated in 1929, and that the mikveh, which opened in 1891, was restored in 1932. In 1933, the 73 Jews of Burghaslach ran numerous associations, including a Talmud Torah association, a women’s organization, a chevra kadisha, a charitable society and branches of several German-Jewish organizations. That year, a teacher of religion instructed 15 schoolchildren. The cemetery was desecrated in 1936 and in 1937. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior, furniture and ritual objects were destroyed; the building was partially burned. All local Jews, including children, were detained in a local inn (for two days) while their homes and businesses were destroyed. Afterwards, three Jewish men spent several days in the regional prison in Scheinfeld, The town’s few remaining Jews left in February 1940. In total, 20 Burghaslach Jews emigrated and 45 relocated in Germany. At least 52 Burghaslach Jews perished in the Shoah.

Burghaun,1509,176 in 1885,112,"The Jewish cemetery in Burghaun, consecrated in or around 1600, served neighboring Jewish communities and was one of the largest and oldest Jewish cemeteries in Hesse. In 1910, the community replaced its old synagogue with a new synagogue at 12 Ringstrasse (98 seats for men and 52 for women). Local Jews also maintained a mikveh and an elementary school, the latter of which (1867-1933) was presided over by teachers who served as ritual slaughterers and cantors. In 1933, 12 children studied at the school. A Jewish women’s association, a charitable society and two youth groups were active in the village. Between 1937 and 1939, Jewish children attended the regional school in Huenfeld. On Pogrom Night, the windows of Jewish homes were smashed; several were looted. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed, the school and mikveh were damaged and most Jewish men were deported to Buchenwald. Seventeen Burghaun Jews were deported to Riga, via Kassel, in December 1941. In September 1942, the village’s last two Jewish families were deported to Theresienstadt.

Burgkunstadt’s Jewish cemetery, consecrated in 1620 and enlarged in 1679, was one of the largest in rural Bavaria. The modern community established a new synagogue in the mid-18th century, a district rabbinate in 1825, an elementary school in 1852, yet another school in 1921, and a mikveh. In 1933, the community’s teacher/chazzan instructed four schoolchildren. A chevra kadisha, a women’s association and a charitable society were active in Burgkunstadt. On Pogrom Night, SA men and local residents ransacked the synagogue and Jewish homes. Shortly afterwards, the synagogue was demolished. All Jewish men were imprisoned for several days. During the Nazi period, 16 Burgkunstadt Jews emigrated and 24 relocated within Germany. In April 1942, 10 Jews were deported to Izbica (via Bamberg). One other Jew was sent to Bamberg in May 1942, and deported from there to Theresienstadt.

Jews did not return to Burgsteinfurt until 1662, when a new community was established there. Services were conducted in a makeshift synagogue (located in a private residence) until 1744, when the authorities finally permitted the Jewish community to build a synagogue. Completed in 1764, the building also housed an apartment for the teacher and a school, the latter of which taught children from many surrounding towns. In 1841, the school received official governmental recognition. Local Jews were proud of the fact that their town was home to two Jewish cemeteries and the largest matzo factory in Europe. On Pogrom Night, between 40 and 50 members of the Hitler Youth smashed the windows of the synagogue and ransacked the interior; the next day, the youths returned and proceeded to burn down the building, after which, two weeks later, the building was razed and the site cleared.

Burgpreppach,17th century,198 in 1890,78,"The Jewish community of Burgpreppach, presumably founded during the Thirty Years’ War, established a district rabbinate and synagogue in 1681. Two more synagogues were founded in Burgpreppach, the oldest of which was built in 1764. The village was home to a Talmud Torah (1875), an elementary school, a mikveh, a cemetery (1708) and a yeshiva (1770s). The Talmud Torah produced more than 1,000 graduates over the years; in 1939, as a result of financial difficulties, it was converted into an elementary school. Two famous Burgpreppach rabbis were Yosef Breslau and Leopold Stein, the latter of whom became rabbi of Frankfurt am Main in 1844. Seventeen pupils attended the elementary school in 1933. In 1934, six Jews were arrested on blood libel charges connected to the nearby village of Manau. On Pogrom Night, the old synagogue, the school and the homes of rabbis and teachers were burned down. Other Jewish homes were vandalized. Twenty-three Burgpreppach Jews emigrated and 23 relocated within Germany. Burgpreppach’s last Jew left in February 1942.

In 1933, the Jewish teacher instructed six schoolchildren; a charitable society was also active in Burgsinn that year. After 1936, the community’s children attended the Jewish school in Mittelsinn. In March 1938, windows in Jewish homes and in the synagogue were smashed. Later that year, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed: five Torah scrolls were torn up and ritual objects were set on fire, but the fire brigade chief stopped the mob from burning down the building. Vandals attacked Jewish homes, Jewish families were arrested, SA men abused Jewish women and seven Jewish men were sent to Lohr, from where five were deported to Dachau. The synagogue was sold to a local resident after the pogrom. Eighteen Burgsinn Jews emigrated and 23 relocated within Germany. The last three were deported to the East (via Wuerzburg) in November 1941. At least 20 Burgsinn Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was converted into a residential building during the 1990s.

Buttenhausen,1755,442 in 1870,89,"A mikveh, financed by local rulers, was built in Buttenhausen in 1787, two years after which the community consecrated a cemetery. The synagogue, built in 1796, was renovated and enlarged in 1871/72. We also know that, in 1836, a Jewish school was opened in the village. Although the Jewish population declined steadily after the 1870s, Lehmann Bernheim established a vocational school in Buttenhausen (1903-1923). In 1933, numerous associations were active in the village, and eight pupils attended the school. During the Nazi period, Salomon Loewental served on the local council (until 1939), the only such case in Germany. On Pogrom Night, an attempt to burn the synagogue was obstructed by the mayor and the fire department; the following day, SA men set fire to the synagogue after detaining the mayor and forbidding the fire department from intervening. Eight Jews were arrested, but released as a result of the mayor’s intervention. Forty-five Buttenhausen Jews left the village, 18 died and four committed suicide. In 1940/41, Jews from other towns and villages were moved to Buttenhausen, increasing the population to 109, all of whom were deported in 1941/42. At least 42 Buttenhausen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Butzbach,1332,148 in 1933,,"Jews lived in Butzbach intermittently until the mid-19th century, when they established a more permanent presence there. Prior to the foundation of the independent Jewish community of Butzbach, local Jews had been members of the Hoch-Weisel community. Butzbach was home to a “Jews’ Alley” and a synagogue by 1384. The modern community conducted services in a prayer room, located on the upper story of the town hall, until 1926, when a synagogue with a seating capacity of 120 was inaugurated on Wetzlarstrasse/ Ludwigsstrasse. Beginning in 1855, the community employed a teacher of religion, who also served as chazzan and shochet. A Jewish section was consecrated inside the general cemetery in 1892. (The 14th-century Jewish cemetery had become town property in approximately 1476.) In October 1933, two local Jews were sent to the Osthofen camp. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. Jewish homes and businesses were attacked and looted, the cemetery was desecrated and three men were sent to Buchenwald. Paula Loeb died from injuries inflicted on her that night. Seventy-three local Jews emigrated, 44 relocated within Germany and died in Butzbach. The remaining Jews were eventually moved into one home, from which 19 were deported to concentration camps in September 1942. At least 82 Butzbach Jews perished in the Shoah.

We also know that Butzweiler was home to a mikveh and a school for religious studies, the latter of which was presided over by a schoolteacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. By 1925, the Jews of nearby Kordel, Ralingen and Edingen had joined the Butzweiler community. Later, in 1932, the Jewish cemetery was desecrated. On Pogrom Night, SA men and local residents broke down the synagogue door, destroyed the interior of the building, threw benches from the women’s balcony and—this was done in the street—ripped apart the Torah scroll; Jewish homes were ransacked and the cemetery was desecrated. The following day, Jews were forced to leave the village and move towards the Luxembourg border; they were not permitted to cross, and many returned to Butzweiler. In May 1939, 16 Jews were still living in Butzweiler. In 1943, the village’s last five Jews were deported to the East, and 19 others were eventually deported from Trier. At least 50 Butzweiler Jews perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue was used for various purposes after the pogrom.

Records from 1770 mention a synagogue, and we also know that, in 1838, a new synagogue was inaugurated at 4 Schmiedegasse (41 seats for men, 24 for women). The community maintained a mikveh and a school for religious studies, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet; the last teacher retired in 1911. Camberg was home to two Jewish cemeteries: the first was consecrated in the mid-19th century, the second, located inside the town’s general burial grounds, in the early 20th century. In 1933, a teacher from Idstein instructed seven schoolchildren in religion. A welfare society and a Jewish society for history and literature were active in Camberg. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and threw out the Torah scrolls and ritual objects, after which the building was destroyed. The homes and businesses of five Jewish families were plundered, a local Jew and his son were assaulted, four men were sent to Buchenwald and a Jewish couple committed suicide. Several weeks later, all gravestones from the two cemeteries were stolen. Thirty-four Jews emigrated (19 went to the United States), 19 relocated within Germany and seven died in Bad Camberg, including four who committed suicide.

Carlsruhe,1742,128 in 1861,42,"Jews hoping for better treatment under Prussian rule first settled in Carlsruhe (Pokoj in today’s Poland) after the Silesian war of 1742. Once there, they found that the city authorities not only exploited Jews by forcing them to pay exorbitant taxes, but also harassed them with ever-changing residency laws. Nevertheless, the community managed to consecrate a cemetery as early as 1780 (at the edge of the forest on Kolejowa Street). At its peak, the community made up 5% of the total population and operated a school (41 students). Services were conducted in a private residence, where a prayer room had been established, until 1864, when the community built a proper synagogue (next to the rabbi’s house) on present-day 3 Maia Street. We also know that in 1872, the Association of Synagogue Communities of Upper Silesia, of which Carlsruhe was a member, was formed. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night; the remains of the structure were later demolished.

Castrop-Rauxel,1699,151 in 1935,125 or 160,"The Jewish community of Castrop developed comparatively late (in the early 19th century), because Castrop was not located near any prominent trade routes. The Jewish cemetery and the prayer hall, the latter of which was located in Joseph Levi’s home on Muensterstasse, were established in 1743 and 1800, respectively. Castrop’s Jewish elementary school, which also housed an apartment for a teacher, was opened in 1839. The school was moved into the newly built synagogue at Am Ort (or Schulstrasse, present-day Simon-Cohen-Platz) in 1845; the timber-framed house of worship was inaugurated—women sat in a designated gallery—on August 15-17, 1845. Later, in 1921/22, an apse was added to the building. Many Castrop Jews prospered during the late 19th century, enabling the community to establish a sisterhood, a literature club and youth organizations. Several Jewish communities eventually merged to form the regional congregation of Castrop-Rauxel, and by the beginning of the 20th century, the majority of important businesses in the area were owned by Jews. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 had little effect in Castrop-Rauxel. Between 1935 and 1939, however, the Jewish population decreased by 75 percent. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, Jewish-owned stores were vandalized and looted, private residences were wrecked and Jews were assaulted. SA men from Herne set fire to the synagogue, after which the city demanded that the congregation remove the ruins, an obviously impossible task. The remaining Jews were eventually moved to designated “Jews’ Houses” and, later, deported. At least 80 local Jews perished in the Shoah (146 according to Yad Vashem).

Chemnitz,1357,"3,500 in 1925","2,387","The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Chemnitz is dated 1357. A ban on Jewish residency was announced in 1539, and it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that it was rescinded, as a result of which, during the 1860s and 1870s, Jewish merchants settled in this industrial city. Founded in 1871, the modern community consecrated a prayer hall (on Neugasse) in 1878 and an actual synagogue (on Stephansplatz) in 1899; the Liberal synagogue, built in the Romanesque style, featured a cupola and a seating capacity of 700. Chemnitz was also home to several Orthodox prayer rooms, mainly used by Eastern European Jews. Other communal institutions included a school for religious studies (founded in 1876) and a cemetery, the latter of which was consecrated on Hoher Weg in 1879 and is still in use. Local Jews hired a rabbi in 1881, and we also know that beginning in 1914, the Jewish population grew as Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe arrived in Chemnitz. After World War I, members of a political organization started arranging anti-Semitic meetings in the city. In 1933, 2,387 Jews lived in Chemnitz. A teacher/ chazzan instructed 155 schoolchildren, and 100 pupils attended the Talmud Torah. A rabbi served the community, which still operated a mikveh and two prayer rooms (on Theaterstrasse and on Feldstrasse). Still active in Chemnitz were 13 Jewish welfare associations, numerous foundations, several local branches of national Jewish organizations and a kindergarten, the last of which was run by the Jewish Women’s League. In March 1933, SA men forced Jews to remove anti- Nazi slogans from buildings and pillars, soon after which, on April 1, 1933, the anti-Jewish boycott was implemented in Chemnitz. Violence erupted, and some Jewish-owned stores were damaged. In October 1938, 300 Polish Jews were expelled from Chemnitz. On the evening of November 9, 1938 (Pogrom Night), SA men and local youths set the synagogue on fire, cheered on by a shouting mob. Jewish-owned stores were looted, windows were smashed and more than 170 local Jews were arrested and taken to Buchenwald. Of these, one was shot, and a few died either during or after their detention. The synagogue was sold in April 1939. The Jewish population figure for that year was 2,096 persons, of whom only a small percentage managed to emigrate from Germany. The remaining Jews were eventually moved into designated Judenhaeuser (“Jews’ houses”) and subjected to forced labor. Between 1942 and 1945, a total of 2,000 local Jews were deported to Riga, Belzyce and Theresienstadt; almost all of them perished in the Shoah. A new Jewish community was established in Chemnitz after the war. In 1988, a commemorative stele and a memorial stone were unveiled, at Stephansplatz and at the Technical University, respectively.

Local Jews established a cemetery in the 18th century; a prayer room, located in a private residence, by 1853; a synagogue in 1860; and a new cemetery in 1877. In 1897, a school house with living quarters for a teacher was built inside the synagogue. In 1933, 32 Jews belonged to the Cochem community, some of whom were from neighboring towns and villages. Twelve children received religious instruction, and a Jewish women’s association and a charity group were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, Cochem’s synagogue was desecrated. By 1939, only 16 Jews still lived in Cochem. The town’s last three Jews were deported to Theresienstadt in June 1942. At least nine local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue, destroyed during an air raid in early 1945, was later demolished. The remains of the second Jewish cemetery can still be found on Kelberger Strasse; this cemetery has been desecrated several times since World War II, most recently in 1995.","Bronagh Bowerman Sources: AJ, EJL, FJG, SG- RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=340,340
Coburg,13th century,316 in 1925,233,"Jews were persecuted in Coburg during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, and were expelled from the town again shortly after 1447. The modern community was founded in 1873. A Catholic church called the Nikolauskapelle, located on Ketscherdorfer Strasse, was converted into a synagogue in 1873 and enlarged in 1889. The community founded a Jewish school in 1873 and a cemetery in 1878. Hermann Hirsch, who was appointed rabbi in 1909, established a Jewish boys’ boarding school in 1917/18. Coburg, a major Nazi stronghold, elected a Nazi mayor in 1929; accordingly, Jews were relentlessly persecuted in the town. In 1932, the authorities gave the order to convert the synagogue back into a church, a decision that the Jewish community unsuccessfully appealed. In 1933, the community still maintained numerous associations and branches of nationwide Jewish organizations. That same year, 30 children studied religion in Coburg. In March of 1933, police closed down the synagogue, after which (in May) a prayer hall was established in Rabbi Hirsch’s home on Hohe Strasse. In 1935, when Jewish pupils were expelled from German schools, the Jewish boarding school took in all of the community’s schoolchildren. On Pogrom Night, the prayer room and its ritual objects were destroyed; Torah scrolls were burned. Jewish pupils were forced to smash the school’s windows, and Jewish homes and stores were damaged. All Jews, including women and children, were arrested; men under the age of 60 were imprisoned in Hof. Eighty-five Coburg Jews emigrated and 61 relocated within Germany. Twenty-five died in Coburg, some of whom took their own lives. The remaining Jews were forced into two houses and, in 1941/42, deported to Riga, Theresienstadt and Izbica. At least 78 Coburg Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial commemorating the town’s Shoah victims was later unveiled at the Jewish cemetery.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn Sources: AJ, CJGS, DJGB, EJL, SIA, SZJLB",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=339,339

It was not until 1667, when eight Jewish families settled there, that a new community emerged in Coesfeld. In 1817, the community established a synagogue and a Jewish school; the school, which was housed inside the synagogue, was in use until the 20th century. We also know that in 1884, the Jews of Coesfeld built a large, ornate synagogue that served many of the surrounding Jewish communities. Although the synagogue was sold to a neighboring resident in early 1938 (when only 35 Jews still lived in Coesfeld), the new owner did not manage to prevent the SS from attacking his property on Pogrom Night; the SS did not, however, burn down the building. Jewish homes and stores were destroyed that night, and the town’s remaining Jews were severely beaten. Renovated in 1967, the synagogue now houses the Evangelical Church of Coesfeld.

Deutz’s Jewish cemetery, already in use in 1695 and located on land leased from the Cologne Archbishopric, served the community until World War I. We also know that local Jews conducted services in a small prayer hall until 1794, when the site was destroyed by flooding and was subsequently rebuilt into a two-story synagogue with schoolrooms and living quarters. It, too, was torn down (to make room for a bridge over the Rhine River) and rebuilt yet again in 1915. In Deutz, many Jews earned a living as moneylenders. Deutz was incorporated into Cologne in 1888. The boycotts of 1933 forced many Jews to leave Deutz. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, the interior of the synagogue was looted and later destroyed. A plaque was later affixed to the building. Another plaque, displayed at the railway station, commemorates the thousands—most of Cologne’s Jews were deported from Deutz—who were sent to Eastern Europe from there.

Records indicate that Muellheim’s synagogue was damaged by flooding in 1784, not long after which, in 1788/89, a new synagogue and adjacent classrooms were built in the area. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue and school buildings. Although the municipality eventually appropriated the site, it was returned to the Jewish Trust Corporation in 1954.

Cologne-Ehrenfeld (Köln / Koeln),1860,"2,000 in 1927","1,167","The suburban community of Ehrenfeld expanded rapidly during the second half of the 19th century. Beginning in 1880, religious services were conducted in a prayer hall attached to the classrooms on Rohenhauserstrasse. Later, in 1908, the Jews of Ehrenfeld inaugurated a new synagogue with a seating capacity of 350 (200 men and 150 women) and a mikveh; an additional prayer hall, established for the benefit of the many Polish Jews who had moved to Ehrenfeld, was added to the synagogue in 1927. The community, an affiliate of Cologne, also maintained an old-age home with an adjacent synagogue. Although the congregation had largely dispersed by November 1938, and although the committee had attempted to sell the synagogue earlier that year, the house of worship was broken into on Pogrom Night; after destroying the benches and almemor, the rioters burned down the building. In 1941/42, the old-age home (it had been spared on Pogrom Night) served as a temporary ghetto from which Jews were eventually deported. The building was later damaged heavily by Allied bombing. The synagogue in the old-age home was rebuilt and re-consecrated in 1945.

Cosel,1773,236 in 1880,83,"Jews settled in Cosel (Koźle in today’s Poland) in the mid- 18th century. By 1796, they had established a prayer room. Cosel became an independent Jewish community in 1820. In 1821, the congregation acquired a building at 28 Malze Street (present-day Sienkiewicza Street) and established a synagogue on its second floor. This arrangement sufficed until 1872, when a new property was purchased at Raciborski Square (present-day 24 Kwietna Street). The new synagogue, a brick building, was consecrated on September 10, 1886; it housed an apartment for the rabbi, and was built in the Neo-Roman style, with an octagonal tower and a round cupola. In Cosel, the Jewish Foundation established a community center and a nursing home. We also know that local Jews used the cemetery in nearby Debova (consecrated in 1814), and that a morgue was built there in 1822. Beginning in 1937, local Jewish children were forbidden from attending public schools. On Pogrom Night, SA men threw grenades into the synagogue, after which they burned down the building.

Coswig,18th century,65 in 1845,9,"At the beginning of the 1770s, several Jewish families obtained residency rights from the Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg. The Jews of Coswig attended services in the synagogue of neighboring Woerlitz until 1800, when they built a small, half-timbered house of worship on Domstrasse; the building was renovated approximately 100 years later. Beginning in 1832, the community belonged to the rabbinate of Anhalt- Bernburg. Always small (membership began to dwindle in the 1850s), the community was never able to hire a chazzan. Herman Cohen (1842-1918), the Jewish philosopher and one of the founders of the Marburg School of Neo- Kantianism, was born in Coswig. Local Jews established a cemetery (on Heidestrasse) and a cemetery hall in 1800 and 1843, respectively. The cemetery was leveled during the Nazi period, and many tombstones were stolen. As of this writing, 36 tombstones are still intact. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue, which had been in use until 1928, was severely damaged; it was finally demolished in 1939.

It was not until 1740 that a permanent Jewish presence was established there. The official Jewish community of Cottbus was formed in 1858. A prayer room on Mauerstrasse, consecrated in 1811, was renovated and converted into a synagogue in 1875. Later, in 1902, a larger, Romanesque-style synagogue with 300 seats was inaugurated on Jahrstrasse. The community consecrated a cemetery on Strasse der Jugend in 1814, prior to which burials had been conducted in Maerkisch-Friedland. A new cemetery was consecrated in South Churchyard, on Dresdener Strasse, in 1918. In 1933, 450 Jews resided in Cottbus, served by a chazzan, a shochet and Rabbi Salomon Posner, the last of whom held that post from 1905 until 1934. Fiftytwo schoolchildren studied religion with Rabbi Posner that year, and three welfare associations—a chevra kadisha (founded in 1877), a Jewish Women’s Association (1887) and the “Achieser” Association for Eastern European Jews (1919)—provided welfare services. We also know that four local branches of national Jewish organizations were active in Cottbus that year. In October 1938, between 30 and 40 Polish Jews were expelled from Cottbus. On Pogrom Night, locals instructed by members of the SS incinerated the synagogue. Jewish businesses and homes were looted and damaged, the old cemetery was desecrated, Jewish residents were assaulted and approximately 30 Jewish men were arrested and, later, taken to Sachsenhausen; of these, two died in December 1938. The synagogue ruins were removed in 1939. The remaining Jews were eventually moved to “Jews’ Houses” and subjected to forced labor. In 1940/41, the deportations to Eastern Europe began, including to Warsaw and to Theresienstadt. At least 38 Cottbus Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1968, a department store was built on the former synagogue site. Nearby, on Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse, two plaques (unveiled in 1988 and 1998) commemorate the former Jewish community; a memorial plaque was unveiled at the new Jewish cemetery in the 1980s.

By the year 1831, the Jewish families had established a prayer room in a residential building called Hecht am Alten Markt. In 1848, Datteln�s Jews�now three families�became part of the district synagogue association of Recklinghausen along with the Jews living in Ahsen, Herten, Horneburg, Waltrop and, of course, Recklinghausen. In 1860, the small Datteln community consisted of three to five families; they held prayer services in a house belonging to the Ellermans, on Tuerkenstrasse. The prayer room was moved twice more: to the Huelsdas family home on Hohen Strasse, and to a house owned by the Sauer family, also on Hohenstrasse. In 1912, Datteln’s Jews purchased a plot of land on the corner of Marktstrasse and Tuerkenstrasse (today 1 Tuerkenort); a small synagogue was built there in 1929. The one-story building contained two rooms; the prayer room seated approximately 40 persons. Rabbi Dr. Steinthal led the synagogue’s inauguration ceremony on December 16, 1929. The last burial in Datteln’s Jewish cemetery took place in 1933, the year of Hitler’s rise to power, when 33 Jews still lived in the town. Twenty-one Jewish residents remained in 1937. On October 23, 1938, the Datteln Jews held the last prayer service in their synagogue; the building was sold in November. There are conflicting reports as to whether the synagogue was the target of Pogrom Night violence. Attacks reportedly took place there on the night of November 10- 11 when, presumably, an attempt was made to burn down the building. We do know, however, that the cemetery was desecrated; it was further damaged by fighting during World War II. According to Yad Vashem, at least 15 Jews who were born in Datteln or lived there for some time perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue was turned into a residence in 1948.

By 1713, 30 Jewish families were living in Darmstadt; and by 1836, the Jewish population had reached 532. Records from 1680 mention a Jewish cemetery in Bessungen, outside of Darmstadt. Burials took place in Alsbach until 1709, after which Darmstadt Jews once again used the cemetery in Bessungen. Darmstadt�s Jewish cemetery (unknown date of construction) is located on Martinstrasse. The community established a synagogue in 1737, soon after which, in 1761, Darmstadt became the seat of a district rabbinate. Another synagogue was inaugurated on the corner of Bleichstrasse and Grafenstrasse in 1873, three years before the community officially aligned itself with Liberal Judaism (1876). Between 1905 and 1906, a new synagogue�290 seats for men, 136 for women�was established in a small alley next to the schoolhouse; architecturally, the synagogue was in the Art Nouveau style. In 1925, the rabbi of the Liberal community was Dr. Julius Merzbach. In 1904, Orthodox Jews seceded from the main community and formed a separate community. Lehmann Marx served as their rabbi between 1897 and 1910, as did Rabbi Moshe Shimshon Wasserman between 1924 and 1930. Beginning in 1923, chazzan/teacher Ludwig Wahrhaftig served the Orthodox community. Arno Bik of Michelstadt presided over the Orthodox school, where 150 students were enrolled in 1936; in 1931/32, 87 students attended the liberal school. In 1932, the leaders of the community were Dr. Bodenheimer and Josef Freitag. A chevra kadisha, a burial society, a Zionist organization and several welfare organizations were active in Darmstadt. On November 10, 1938 (Pogrom Night) SS and SA men, acting on orders issued in Starkenburg, burned down both synagogues and blew up the mikveh. The rabbinate building, which housed the archives and the synagogue caretaker�s apartment, was spared. Private properties (including a furniture shop owned by an ethnic German whose wife was Jewish) were destroyed, and 169 Jewish men were arrested and later sent to Buchenwald. A makeshift school, presided over by the community chairman and a teacher named Rothschild, was established in Darmstadt in 1939; in February of that year, 68 students attended classes there. Eleven older students attended school in Mainz. In the spring of 1939, Rabbi Mertzbach immigrated to Palestine, where he became the head of a yeshiva in Jerusalem. Rothschild, the teacher, replaced him as rabbi. The deportations of Darmstadt's Jews began in December 1940. Between 1942 and 1943, approximately 380 local Jews were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and other death camps. Darmstadt's Jewish population was 491 in 1940, 464 in 1942 and 213 in July 1944. At least 1,000 Darmstadt Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1959, bronze memorial plaques were unveiled in Darmstadt. Memorial ""stumbling blocks"" were, in recent years, also laid there. Jewish arrivals from the former USSR rejuvenated the community - 130 Jews were living in Darmstadt in 1992 -  and the cemetery was enlarged in 2001.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: AJ, EJL, GJHKGJH, PK-HNF www.shalomdelaware.org",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=354,354

Delmenhorst’s Jewish cemetery, acquired in 1848, was also used by the Jews of Ganderkesee and Berne. We also know that the Jewish school became an elementary school in 1894, and that a new synagogue was built in 1928. Between 1909 and 1937, during which time the school was closed, Alexander Freund served as teacher and chazzan. In 1933, the community established a gymnastics club for youth and a Pfadfinder (pathfinder) club. On Pogrom Night, Nazis burned down the synagogue and broke the windows of the remaining Jewish business; 16 men were sent to Sachsenhausen, after which (a few days later), they were released on condition that they leave Delmenhorst immediately. The Jewish population dropped from 51 in November of 1938 to 21 at the end of 1939. Approximately 105 local Jews managed to immigrate to the United States, South America and Palestine. Approximately 75 were murdered in the Shoah, of whom 33 perished in Minsk and 8 (at least) in Theresienstadt and Auschwitz. The cemetery was vandalized in 1966 and 1970. In 1979 a monument was unveiled in Delmenhorst.

Dessau on Saale,1672 (25 families),807 in 1818 (approximately 9% of total pop.),306,"The Jewish community of Dessau established a cemetery and synagogue in 1674 and 1687, respectively. Prominent Dessau Jews included the following: Moses Benjamin Wulff, the founder of a Hebrew press; Rabbi David Fraenkel, who not only served as rabbi between 1737 and 1743, but initiated a new printing of the works of Maimonides and founded a Beit Midrash; Moses Mendelssohn, the German-Jewish philosopher; Ludwig Philippson (1811-1889), a prominent rabbi and author; and, finally, Kurt Weill (1900-1950), the German-Jewish philosopher. In 1786, a Jewish gymnasium was established in Dessau, in opposition to the wishes of the community; later, in 1825, the gymnasium merged with the Juedische Freischule or “Jewish Free School” (1799-1848), the latter of which was founded on the teachings of Mendelssohn. Dessau was also the birthplace of Sulamith, the first German-language Jewish periodical. In 1908, the Cohn-Oppenheim Foundation financed the construction of a new synagogue at 11/14 Steinstrasse. Dessau’s Jewish community, with which the 20 Jews of Rosslau were affiliated, counted 306 members in 1933. Five members sat on the community board in 1932/33, and Dr. Cohn and Dr. Altherhom served as community leaders. S. Hirschfeld was treasurer, and Dr. Walter, the provincial rabbi, presided over a representative committee of 17 members. Jewish welfare organizations included a local branch of the Jewish Welfare Society (headed by S. Hirschfeldt), a chevra kadisha (46 members), the Israelitischer Frauenverein (75 female members) and the Baronin-von-Cohn-Oppenheim Fund (established in 1903). Dr. Cohn headed the Anhalt Lodge, and Hurwitz, a lawyer, was in charge of a local Zionist group. In Dessau, Pogrom Night began at 3 p.m. on November 9, 1938. The community center and synagogue were set on fire, Jewish-owned homes and stores were ransacked—according to one report, the looters paraded their “trophies” through the streets—and Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald. Joseph Schuber managed to save one Torah scroll, which, in 1939, he brought to Palestine. Of the 129 Jews who lived in Dessau in 1939, most were deported, and most perished in the Shoah. At least 119 Dessau Jews perished in the Shoah. In November 1988, a sandstone monument with a menorah was unveiled in memory of the destroyed community. A new Jewish community developed in Dessau in the mid- 1990s; in 2005, Dessau was home to 380 Jews. The Moses-Mendelssohn Society, established in Dessau in 1993, investigates Jewish history in Germany.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: EJL, FJG, JVL, LJG, YV www.mendelssohn-dessau.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=358,358
Dettelbach,1675,130 in 1837,39,"The Jews of Dettelbach maintained a cemetery between the 17th and 19th centuries, after which burials were conducted in Schwanfeld. Records indicate that Dettelbach was home to a synagogue during the 18th century, and we know for certain that the modern community established a new synagogue (at 4 Haefnermarkt) in 1862 and a Jewish elementary school in 1909. By 1924, enrollment had dropped to such an extent that the school (it was located inside the synagogue) was forced to limit its curriculum to religious instruction only. The community also maintained a mikveh. In 1933, a chevra kadisha and a women’s association were still active in Dettelbach. Orthodox Jewish youth groups regularly traveled to Dettelbach for day trips. The synagogue was desecrated on Pogrom Night, and there is reason to believe that it was the mayor who set the curtains on fire. A non-Jewish school was established in the synagogue building after the pogrom. Fifteen Dettelbach Jews emigrated; three relocated within Germany; twelve were deported to Izbica, via Wuerzburg, in April 1942; and 11, the last (including the teacher, Avraham Mannheimer), were deported to Theresienstadt in September 1942. At least 43 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was demolished in 1962.

Detmold,1500,240 in 1895,156,"The Jewish community of Detmold, which by the early 18th century was the center of Jewish life in the Lippe district, established the following communal institutions: a cemetery in or around 1652 (enlarged in 1726); a rented prayer hall in 1712; a synagogue on present-day 8a Exterstrasse in 1742; a school for children from poor families (first mentioned in 1799); an elementary school in 1808; a new cemetery in the Spitzenkamptwete in 1883; and, finally, a new synagogue—154 seats for men, 88 for women—in 1907 (on 3, Lortzingerstrasse). As the rabbi for Lippe and Paderborn resided in Warburg, an assistant rabbi was appointed in Detmold in 1702; rabbis for the Lippe region served in Detmold for a short period after 1776 and between 1861 and 1874. The elementary school closed in 1913, after which the community employed a teacher of religion who also served as chazzan and shochet. In 1933, ten schoolchildren received religious instruction. Several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community. In Detmold, the anti-Jewish boycott, the dismissal of Jewish teachers and other discriminatory practices were implemented early on. Jews were beaten and humiliated, and the cemetery was desecrated in 1935. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned to the ground, Jewish homes and businesses were wrecked and plundered and the community shamash was assaulted; Jewish men and women were arrested, and 12 or 13 men were sent to Buchenwald, where one died. By 1939, the remaining 66 Jews had been moved to six designated houses. One of these homes accommodated a prayer hall, an old-age home and a school, the last of which was reopened that year and served 14 pupils. Jews were deported from Detmold beginning in December 1941. At least 152 Detmold Jews perished in the Shoah. Detmold’s new Jewish community, founded in 1946, merged with Herford in 1970. Memorials were erected on the street on which the synagogue once stood, and near the old synagogue in 1963 and 1988, respectively.

Deutsche Krone,1623,647 in 1871,250,"The first available record of a Jewish presence in Deutsche Krone (present-day Walcz, Poland) is dated 1623. Jews were initially restricted to designated areas, forbidden from living in the old city and forced to pay special taxes. By 1698, however, Deutsche Krone had seven Jewish homes (each housing four Jewish families) and a synagogue. The Jewish community grew during the late 18th century, reaching its peak, 647 Jews, in 1871. Deutsche Krone suffered two fires during that century: one in 1706 and another, which destroyed the synagogue, in 1771. A new synagogue was built in the early 1790s, and we also know that the community maintained an elementary school (1842-1912) and a cemetery. Deutsche Krone was among the few West Prussian localities to remain in Germany after World War I. Although many Jewish-owned businesses were aryanized during the Nazi period, Jewish peddlers and horse dealers were able to continue working until November 10, 1938, when the synagogue (inaugurated in 1921) was burned down in the pogrom; Jewish-owned businesses were also demolished and Jewish men taken to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Only 57 Jews lived in Deutsche Krone on Pogrom Night; those who had not left the town by March 1940 were interned in Schneidemuehl and later deported to the East.","Fred Gottlieb Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=361,361
Dieburg,early 14th century,169 in 1880,159,"Dieburg’s modern Jewish community conducted services in prayer rooms until 1849, when a synagogue was inaugurated. Local Jews opened another synagogue (at the marketplace) in 1869, but that house of worship was closed down in 1928 as a result of structural safety concerns; one year later, in 1929, the community consecrated a new synagogue on the same site. We also know that Dieburg’s Jewish cemetery, established before 1530, became a regional cemetery in 1815. In 1937, by which point the community could no longer pay debts accumulated during the construction of the synagogue, the town appropriated the building. The synagogue interior was nevertheless destroyed on Pogrom Night; Jewish homes and businesses were ransacked that night, and 10 men were sent to Buchenwald. Ninety-four local Jews emigrated, 42 relocated within Germany, seven passed away and one committed suicide. In 1941, Dieburg’s last Jews were moved into one house, from which 16 were deported to Auschwitz and Theresienstadt between September 1942 and March 1943. At least 50 Dieburg Jews perished in the Shoah. Displaced Persons (DPs) established a new Jewish community in Dieburg in 1945; and in 1947, they reinaugurated the synagogue. The community, however, dispersed in 1948, after which the synagogue building was used for various purposes until its demolition in 1965. A bank, to which a memorial plaque was affixed in 1988, now stands on the site.

Diemerode,17th century,101 in 1861 (24.4% of the total population),18,"The Jewish community of Diemerode was founded in 1725. Records from that year mention a synagogue—it may have housed a mikveh—located in a Jewish residence at 10 Dorfstrasse. Diemerode’s Jewish elementary school, established, at the latest, in 1859, was located in a rented building (55 Dorfstrasse) and presided over by a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. The community purchased the school in 1868, after which a synagogue was inaugurated there; the school, however, was closed down in 1882. We also know that burials took place in Sontra until 1862, when a Jewish cemetery was consecrated northeast of the village. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was broken into and its interior destroyed. The businesses and homes of the three remaining Jewish families were ransacked. Six local Jews emigrated, three relocated within Germany and five passed away. Five Jews, the village’s last, were deported to the East in June 1942. At least 24 Diemerode Jews perished in the Shoah. Polish forced laborers and French POWs were housed in the synagogue building during the war. The municipality purchased the building in 1951, and in 1958 it was converted into a warehouse for the fire brigade. The building was pulled down in 1974, and the site now accommodates a residence and a garage.","Heike Zaun Goshen Sources: AH, AJ, EJL, PK-HNF, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=363,363

Local Jews joined the regional Jewish community of Neuwied in 1864, but later formed an independent Jewish community. The Jews of Dierdorf established the following communal institutions: a cemetery, located on the edge of the Giershofen district, in 1746; a Jewish school in 1825; a synagogue in 1829; and a new cemetery, at 48 Flurstueck, in 1846. The Jewish school, rebuilt in 1910, was later closed down, as community membership declined considerably during the 20th century (84 Jews in 1925). Nevertheless, a new synagogue was inaugurated in 1928. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue, assaulted local Jews and plundered Jewish-owned homes and businesses. During the Nazi period, 21 Dierdorf Jews emigrated, among them fourteen who settled in the United States. Those Jews who remained in the town were eventually sent to the camps, the last four in 1942. At least 36 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1989, the Jewish cemetery was recognized as a protected monument.

Diepholz,17th century,78 in 1848,37,"The peak population figure for the Jewish community of Diepholz includes Jews from several neighboring communities. Community members were mainly cattle traders, butchers and textile merchants. A cemetery was consecrated on Schlesierstrasse/ Pommernstrasse in 1774. In 1835, the community replaced its prayer room with a synagogue on Muehlenstrasse; renovated in 1904 and 1907, the building included a school and an apartment for a teacher who, at times, served as shochet and chazzan. Jewish men and women not only donated generous sums to local charities, but also took an active part in the town’s social life, joining local clubs and organizations such as the sports club, the local choir and the fire brigade. A Jewish women’s association was established in Diepholz in 1929. On Pogrom Night, Jewish homes and businesses were severely damaged, their owners arrested; the synagogue was vandalized and plundered, and the cemetery was desecrated. By 1939, only eight Jews lived in Diepholz; they were deported to concentration camps in 1942. After the war, Diepholz briefly served as a transit camp for survivors. Although the synagogue was rededicated in 1946, the building was pulled down in 1953 and replaced by a combined residential and commercial building. Memorials were erected at the synagogue site and cemetery in 1980 and 1997, respectively.

Diersburg,17th century,306 in 1832,26,"This Jewish community, which traced its origins to the second half of the 18th century, maintained the following institutions: a cemetery (consecrated in 1773), an elementary school (1830-1876) and a synagogue, the last of which was, apparently, inaugurated in 1801. We also know that the synagogue housed a school and a mikveh. During the late 1920s, by which point it had become difficult to gather 10 men for a minyan, Jews were brought in from Friesenheim. In 1933, a teacher/chazzan instructed four children in religion. All Jewish-owned businesses had been closed or sold by 1938, after which many local Jews worked as agricultural laborers. On Pogrom Night, SA men destroyed the synagogue’s interior and burned the ritual objects and Torah scrolls; all Jewish men were sent to Dachau. In 1939, the community was ordered to demolish the synagogue at its own expense; the remaining Jews were unable to do so, and the synagogue was sold to a private buyer. Nine Diersburg Jews emigrated, five relocated within Germany and 11 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940; one woman, too sick to be included in the deportation, died in the Offenburg hospital. At least 31 Diersburg Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building, which was renovated in 1956 after the roof collapsed, now accommodates a carpenter’s shop.

The Jews of Diez established the following communal institutions: a cemetery in the 17th century; a synagogue in 1706; a new synagogue, at 36 Altstadtstrasse, in 1760; another new synagogue, at 9 Kanalstrasse, in 1863; a Jewish orphanage—it had its own synagogue and was located at 23 Schlossberg—in 1888; and finally, a new cemetery in or around 1890. We also know that the community maintained a mikveh, and that it hired a teacher of religion who functioned as chazzan and shochet. By 1933, the 26 Jews of Balduinstein, Birlenbach, Freiendiez and Cramberg had been affiliated with the community. Anti-Jewish demonstrations in 1935 forced the management of the orphanage to evacuate the children living there (50 in 1933), after which, in August of that year, the municipality appropriated the building. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the interior of the synagogue was destroyed; one Jewish man was arrested. During the Nazi period, five Jews from Diez and its affiliated communities emigrated and 63 relocated within Germany. In May 1943, one elderly Jewish woman (the only Jew who remained in Diez after 1939) was deported to Auschwitz. At least 33 Diez Jews perished in the Shoah.

Services were later conducted in a private residence, but we do not know when the community decided to congregate there. Records do tell us, however, that a proper synagogue was inaugurated in Dillingen in 1924. In 1933, 27 schoolchildren studied religion under the guidance of a teacher/chazzan. Three charity associations were active in the community, with which the Jews of Nalbach and Pachtlen were affiliated. In December 1934, a Jewish councilman was voted out of office on the pretext that he had missed some meetings. Most Jews left Dillingen after the Saarland region was incorporated into the German Reich in 1935, and the community was disbanded later that year, when only 11 Jews of voting age still lived in the town. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down, the remaining 14 Jews were assaulted, one of whom was brutally beaten with a hammer, and Jewish homes were vandalized.

The community buried its dead in Pfaffenhausen, but maintained its own mikveh. By 1937, as a result of the economic boycott, Dittlofsroda’s ten remaining Jews were receiving welfare support. In early 1938, when the community could no longer gather a minyan, its members were affiliated with Voelkerleier, after which the two communities conducted joint monthly services, alternating between synagogues. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, the interior of the synagogue in Dittlofsroda was destroyed along with its ritual objects. The building itself survived the pogrom. In December 1940, the houses of the village’s four remaining Jews were searched for secretly stockpiled food. Two Jews emigrated from Dittlofsroda (one went to South Africa and the other to Palestine); 13 relocated within Germany (mainly to Frankfurt am Main); and two, the last, were deported, via Wuerzburg, to Theresienstadt in September 1942.

The records tell us that a mikveh was installed in the building in 1893 (the same year during which the gallery was enlarged), and that changes were made to the exterior in 1910. Dinslaken’s Jewish cemetery on auf den Doelen (presentday Friedrich-Ebert-Strasse) was consecrated in 1722. In 1912, in response to the fact that construction on the street was growing increasingly invasive, the cemetery was moved to Wasserturmstrasse. In 1885, the community purchased a residential building on Neustrasse and set up an orphanage there. The orphanage, which served as a social center, accommodated a small synagogue and, beginning in 1931, a kindergarten. Various charity groups were active in Dinslaken, including one that attended to the needs of the sick. Jews and Jewish-owned stores were attacked in 1920. In 1936, the synagogue was vandalized and looted by local high school students. Many Dinslaken Jews left for larger cities during the mid- 1930s. On Pogrom Night, SA men, assisted by local students and their teachers, destroyed the interior of the orphanage and set the synagogue and several neighboring Jewish homes on fire. Jewish men were arrested and severely beaten, after which they were sent to Dachau; children and staff members from the orphanage were sent to Cologne—from where they eventually immigrated to the Netherlands—but not before being dragged through the streets and humiliated.

On November 10, rioters further damaged the building, so that one week later all that remained of the house of worship was the remnants of its walls. Twenty-one Dornheim Jews managed to flee to the United States and England; nine others were deported. Jewish men, initially imprisoned in the schoolroom, were later deported to Buchenwald.

Dortmund,11th century,"4,500 in 1930","4,108 (in June)","The earliest record of Jews in Dortmund is dated 1074; at that time, Jewish merchants were known to pass through the city. The persecution of Jews in Dortmund during the First Crusade (1096) has been documented also. There is no indication of permanent Jewish settlement in the city until the early 13th century, although a Jewish cemetery was established outside the city walls in 1136. By 1252, Dortmund was home to an organized Jewish community with its own synagogue and mikveh. Those Jews lived in the Judengasse (“Jews’ Alley”), in the area of today’s Luehringshof. Dortmund’s medieval Jews, protected by the Counts of the Mark, made a living through moneylending. During the Black Death persecutions (1350) Dortmund’s Jews were accused of well poisoning; some were killed, and the survivors expelled. The Count of the Mark and the local authorities confiscated the property the Jews left behind. Eventually, in 1372, the city authorities, in need of money-lending services, invited Jews to return for a limited time. These Jews were given back the mikveh, the cemetery and possibly the old synagogue too, in return for the payment of fees. By 1380, 10 Jewish families lived there; Shimshon ben Shmuel of Dueren was their rabbi. As Dortmund gradually lost its status as a political and economic hub, its Jewish population declined to zero (by the mid-15th century). Jews returned in the 16th century but were expelled again in 1596; they settled in towns in the surrounding area: Castrop, Dorstfeld, Hoerde, Schwerte and Unna. Thereafter there is no record of Jewish life in Dortmund until the modern era. Jews were granted permission to come back to Dortmund at the beginning of the 19th century, and did so in increasing numbers from the middle of that century onwards. In the early 20th century up until the Nazi period, Dortmund’s Jews, apart from the poorer arrivals from Eastern Europe, were mostly upper middle-class. They earned a living as businessmen, salesmen and in the professions; some were artisans. Jews were increasingly active in public life after the Emancipation; in 1910, three served on the city council, and one was chairman of the local medical society. The Eastern European Jews made a living through petty trade, peddling and crafts. In 1818, Dortmund’s Jews worshiped in a prayer room in the home of Jacob Salomon. In 1853, a small synagogue was built on the Wuestenhof. As the community grew, plans were made to build a new synagogue; a plot of land was purchased on Hiltropwall in the city center in the 1890s. The new synagogue, designed by architect Eduard von Fuerstenau, was inaugurated on June 6, 1900. The synagogue, which had a 40-meter high cupola; a room for weekday prayers on the ground floor with its own Torah Ark; a mikveh; a choir loft; an organ; and seating for 1,270 worshipers, cost 501,000 Marks to build. Its congregation was affiliated with the Jewish communities in Luetjendortmund and Mengede. Dortmund’s Orthodox, Eastern European Jews, who arrived during World War I and lived in the northern part of the city, operated several prayer rooms of their own. Those prayer rooms were located on Zimmerstrasse, Leopoldstrasse (there was a mikveh in house number 31 on that street), and possibly on Heiligegartenstrasse and on Muensterstrasse too. There were also separate synagogues in the Dorstfeld and Hoerde districts of the city. In 1861, the medieval cemetery was replaced by a new burial ground in Dorstfeld; which was used by the Dortmund community too. Another Jewish cemetery was laid in Dortmund itself, in the Ostpark, in 1888. Dortmund’s Jews opened a private elementary school in 1840; which became a public Jewish elementary school in 1858. The school changed address numerous times: in 1870/1871 it moved to 9 Breitenstrasse; to Kampstrasse (to a new building) in 1889; to 51a Lindenstrasse in 1930 (the school had 300 pupils that year); and, in 1937/1938, to 14 Kampstrasse II. In addition to the elementary school, Dortmund’s Jewish community ran a handcrafts school and a Talmud Torah; around 80 children attended afternoon classes in the latter in 1932. There was also a Jewish community center which, like the school, was moved on several occasions; the last time was in 1937, to the Jewish school building on Kampstrasse II. The center closed down in 1941. In 1933, up to 4,200 Jews lived in Dortmund, making up 0.8% of the city’s total population. The Jewish community operated numerous charitable and welfare associations, including a soup kitchen and women’s society. There was also an orchestra, a choir and community newsletter. Jews were members of non-Jewish professional organizations and sports clubs too. Dortmund was traditionally a worker’s town with few Nazi Party supporters in the movement’s early years; anti-Jewish incidents were therefore rare until the boycott of Jewish businesses in 1933. Nevertheless, Dortmund’s boycott began a few days early, on March 28. Entrances to Jewish shops were blocked; the SA and SS arrested Jewish doctors, lawyers, department store employees and business owners. They were taken into “protective custody,” only to be released shortly afterwards. On April 1, the day of the official boycott in the rest of Germany, anti-Jewish placards were displayed in the street, flyers were distributed, and SA men barred the entrances to Jewish-owned shops. In 1934, incidents of vandalism, violence and harassment increased: Jewish properties were graffitied; their windows smashed. The number of pupils in the Jewish school went up as Jewish children were excluded from state schools. The city theater was banned from staging a Wagner opera, because Jewish artists were to be involved in its production. In 1935, anti-Jewish demonstrations were held in which Jews were accused of being traitors, murderers, defilers of women and of attempting to start a war. The persecution intensified to such an extent that approximately one third of Dortmund’s Jewish population left; 800 of those who remained became dependent on financial aid. Nevertheless, during those years, Dortmund’s branch of the Jewish Cultural Association continued to offer plays, lectures and concerts. The community newsletter published articles on Palestine and Jewish history. Vocational training and lessons in Hebrew and English were intensified; the Palestine Office and Hehalutz organized immigration to Palestine. After the synagogues in Munich and Nuremberg were demolished in August 1938— at that time there were 2,600 Jews in Dortmund—Dortmund’s city council decided to do the same. The official reason given for the demolition of the synagogue, which was described as a “shameful stain” on the city’s landscape, was the need to improve traffic flow. This excuse exempted the city council from paying the 1 million Reichsmarks it would have owed the Jewish community had the building been “aryanized.” Eventually, under the threat of violence, the community leadership opted, on September 19, 1938, to “voluntarily” sell the synagogue and its land; 135,000 Reichsmarks were to be paid for the plot; nothing for the synagogue building itself. After the city council approved the purchase, Dortmund’s district Nazi leader arranged for a crowd to gather outside the synagogue and destroy its interior, breaking the promise made to the community leaders that they would have eight days to remove ritual items from the building. Nevertheless, some Torah scrolls were reportedly rescued from the building and kept in the community’s offices. A Torah pointer also survived and was discovered in nearby Unna in 1987. After the sale was agreed, it was claimed that anti-Nazi materials had been found in the synagogue; as a consequence the purchase price was reduced. Even then, the state still deducted taxes from the amount; the Jewish community eventually received a pitiful sum. Demolition work began on October 3, 1938; the walls were dynamited on October 19. By December the site had been completely cleared. Reportedly, the remains of the synagogue were set on fire on Pogrom Night, November 9-10, 1938. It is not known whether the Orthodox prayer rooms in the north of the city were attacked; SA and SS troops did, however, inflict heavy violence on Dortmund’s Jewish community: Jewish homes and businesses were wrecked, their owners forced to pay money to the vandals. Jewish men were arrested; most of them sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where 17 died. Five hundred Jews fled the city after the pogrom. In June 1941, 1,222 Jews were still in Dortmund. They were forbidden to use public shelters, radios, telephones or even the streets without permission. Gradually, they were moved into communal accommodation in so-called “Jews’ houses.” The deportations, which included Jews from Dortmund and from the surrounding area, began in 1942 and ended in early 1945. Eight transports in total, each containing around 5,000 persons, left the city destined for the ghettos and camps. At least 2,200 Dortmund Jews died in the Shoah. After the war, in the summer of 1945, a new Jewish community with 50 members, most of whom were survivors of the Theresienstadt ghetto, was founded in Dortmund. In 1952, the community was awarded 800,000 Deutschmarks as compensation for the synagogue; the city council retained ownership of the site, which was renamed Platz der Alten Synagoge (“the old synagogue square”) and today is the forecourt of the city theater. A commemorative plaque was erected there in 1990. Memorial plaques for Jews deported from Dortmund have been erected in various locations around the city. The synagogue in Dortmund today, at 9 Prinz Friedrich Karl Strasse, was inaugurated in April 1988 (it replaced an older synagogue established in 1956 at the same address). In 2006, Dortmund’s Jewish community had more than 4,000 members.","Bronagh Bowerman Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=374,374
Dransfeld,14th century,111 in 1863,40,"The modern Jewish community of Dransfeld, which emerged in the 18th century, was made up largely of cattle and horse traders, grain and textile merchants, used-goods dealers, shopkeepers and farm hands. In 1826, the Jews of Dransfeld moved their prayer room on Lange Strasse (it had been used since 1700) to a new building at 87 Gerlandstrasse; that same year, an official Jewish community was registered in Dransfeld. Later, in 1836, the community inaugurated a new synagogue on 102 Gerlandstrasse. Dransfeld’s Jewish school, established in a rented house in or around 1800, was eventually moved to a new building opposite the synagogue; the new building—it was owned by the community—also accommodated a mikveh. We also know that the Jewish cemetery on Am hohen Hagen became community property in 1853. Beginning in the mid-19th century, local Jews were active in the town council. According to records, the community maintained a charitable organization. The Jewish school was closed in 1933. By the beginning of 1938, only 17 Jews remained in town. In use until 1937, the synagogue was vandalized on Pogrom Night, its interior set on fire. Dransfeld’s remaining Jews were deported between 1941 and 1944. At least ten Jews from Dransfeld perished in the Shoah. Today, the former synagogue is registered as a historical monument but is used as a carpenter’s shop. A memorial plaque was erected there in 1983.","Heike Zaun Goshen Sources: AH, HU, JGNB1, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=377,377
Dortmund-Hoerde,1505,approximately 400 in 1927,,"The earliest available record of a Jewish family in Hoerde is dated 1505. Few Jews, however, were permitted to settle there before the beginning of the 18th century. Founded in 1789/90, the community initially conducted services in private prayer rooms. The Jews of Hoerde received equal rights in 1808, when Hoerde was under French rule; this, coupled with the development of industry, triggered considerable growth in the Jewish population. In 1818, the community purchased a house on the corner of Lange Strasse and Goldstrasse for use as a synagogue. Finally, in 1900, local Jews inaugurated a magnificent synagogue—an organ was used during services—on Victoriastrasse (present-day Semerteichstrasse). Although the Liberal congregation was incorporated into Dortmund in 1927, it (and its affiliated communities) remained independent. The synagogue was renovated in 1929. Other communal institutions included a private Jewish elementary school (established in 1842) and two cemeteries: at Muehlentor (consecrated in the mid-18th century) and on Hoerder Kampweg (1914-1967). In 1933, 237 Jews lived in Hoerde. Thirty-one schoolchildren received religious instruction, and a Jewish women’s association provided services to the sick and indigent. The synagogue, which had been desecrated on several occasions during the 1930s, was set on fire by SA troops on Pogrom Night. In Hoerde, Jewish homes and stores were vandalized during the pogrom. The synagogue ruins were torn down in or around 1940, and we also know that the cemetery was largely destroyed during the Nazi period. Sixty-nine Jews lived in Hoerde in 1939, some of whom managed to emigrate. Beginning in January 1942, the Jews of Hoerde were deported, together with those from Dortmund, to the concentration camps. At least 43 Hoerde Jews perished in the Shoah. At the synagogue site, which now accommodates a residential building, a memorial plaque was unveiled in 1982, as was a commemorative stele at a later date.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn Sources: EJL, FJG, HU, LJG, SIA, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=376,376
Dortmund - Dorstfeld,17th century,110 in 1885,83,"Jews arrived in Dorstfeld at some point in the 1600s, after they were banished from the nearby city of Dortmund. The Dorstfeld authorities announced that they would welcome these Jews, triggering the establishment of what would become the largest and most important Jewish community in the area during this period. It is worth noting that in 1818, when the ban on Jews living in Dortmund was rescinded, Dorstfeld lost half of its Jewish population in fewer than 25 years. Services were conducted in private residences until 1818, when a modest synagogue, with a simple wooden door and plain glass windows, was built in Dorstfeld. The curtains were not made of silk, but, rather, of inexpensive cotton, and the furniture, including the ark, was of low-grade cedar. The synagogue was renovated in 1860, and a small school was constructed adjacent to the building. Anti-Semitism escalated in early 1938: the exterior of the synagogue was defaced with anti-Semitic slogans, Jewish-owned businesses were vandalized and Jews were humiliated and mocked in the streets. The deteriorating situation climaxed on Pogrom Night, when SA members broke the synagogue’s windows and demolished the interior; the Torah scrolls and other holy books were thrown onto the street and set on fire. The synagogue building was torn down in 1940. A granite block, with a plaque mounted on it, was later unveiled near the former synagogue site.","Moshe Finkel Sources: LJG, SIA, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=375,375
Drensteinfurt,1579,54 in 1885,36,"As was the case in many of Germany's smaller Jewish communities, the Jews of Drensteinfurt initially conducted services in a prayer room. Inaugurated in 1872 (the land had been purchased in 1870), the community's synagogue remained in use until Pogrom Night; at the last Sabbath service held there, the town's remaining Jews celebrated a Bar Mitzvah. On Pogrom Night, rioters burned the synagogue's contents. Due to its proximity to other structures, the synagogue building was not set on fire. An unidentified person managed to rescue one of the Torah scrolls, after which it was given to a local Catholic priest who eventually shipped the scroll to a synagogue in Buenos Aires. Although the synagogue was converted into a cultural center in November 1990, it still retains the architectural characteristics of a synagogue. In honor of Drensteinfurt's former Jewish community and synagogue, the synagogue's street, Kirchgasse, was renamed Synagogengasse; according to records, the street had once been called Judengasse.","Moshe Finkel Sources: EJL, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=378,378
Drove,mid-1600s,66 in 1919,36,"In 1865, the Jewish community of Drove built a new synagogue. Erected on the same site on which an older house of worship had once stood, the new building also served the neighboring Jews of Untermaubach, whose synagogue had been closed down as a result of structural damage. On Pogrom Night, members of the SS murdered Drove’s remaining Jews. Although the town’s non-Jewish population was sympathetic to the plight of their Jewish neighbors, they were unable to stop the outrages committed that night, when SS men ordered the fire department to pour gasoline around the synagogue building and set it on fire. It is rumored that the local Catholic church offered the Jews refuge; the SS commandment, hearing of this, warned that his men would burn down the church if any Jews were found there. Memorial stones were unveiled at the synagogue site in 1971 and in 1987.","Moshe Finkel Sources: SIA, EJL, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=380,380
Dresden,11th or 12th century,"5,120 in 1925","4,675 (0.7% of the total population)","Records indicate that Jews settled in Dresden as early as the 11th/12th centuries. The medieval community (of the 13th and 14th centuries) maintained a synagogue on the Judenhof (“Jews’ yard”) and a cemetery near Kreuztor. Although Jews were persecuted in Dresden in 1348/49 and in 1430, a new Jewish presence was established there at some point between 1475 and 1550. The modern community was founded in the early 18th century. Services were conducted in prayer rooms until 1840, when local Jews finally inaugurated a synagogue— it was designed by architect Gottfried Semper—on 1b Zeughausstrasse (Hasenberg). Under the guidance of Chief Rabbi Zacharias Frankel, the community observed liberal rites. We also know that Dresden was home to two Jewish cemeteries: on Pulsnitzer Strasse (consecrated in 1751) and on Fiedlerstrasse (consecrated in 1867 and enlarged in 1920). Due to the arrival in Dresden of an influx of Eastern European Jews at the beginning of the 20th century, the city’s Jewish population peaked at 5,120 in 1925. Orthodox Jews conducted their own religious services in several prayer halls. In 1933, 4,675 Jews resided in Dresden. A rabbi, a chief chazzan, a chazzan, a shochet, and a teacher served the community. In 1932/33, 550 Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction; eighty students attended the Talmud Torah on Cranachstrasse. Active in the community were six social institutions and 15 welfare associations; there was also a library. We also know that the community published a monthly journal in 1933, and that it established a Jewish school in April 1935. On April 1, 1933, the anti-Jewish boycott was implemented in Dresden, as a result of which Jewish-owned stores were vandalized and Jewish residents assaulted. Many Jews accordingly left the city, and in October 1938, approximately 500 Jews of Polish origin were deported. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was incinerated; a member of the fire brigade managed to save the Star of David from the blaze. Jewish-owned shops and homes were looted that night, and more than 150 Jews were taken to Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen. The synagogue ruins were torn down a few weeks after the pogrom. In the fall of 1939, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into so-called “Jews’ houses.” Later, in November 1942, approximately 300 Jews were taken to the Hellerberg labor camp, which closed in March 1943. At the end of 1944, concentration camp inmates were brought to Dresden to work in the arms industry. Deportations began in January 1942, between then and January 1944, 12 transports carrying approximately 1,300 Jews left for Riga, Theresienstadt and other places in Eastern Europe. After the war, the funeral hall (the Tahara) at the Jewish cemetery on Fiedlerstrasse was converted into a synagogue (1950-2001). In 2001, a new synagogue and a community center were established at 1 Hasenberg, which corresponds roughly to the location of the destroyed synagogue designed by Semper. The original Star of David adorns the new synagogue’s entrance, next to which a memorial stone was unveiled in 1975. In 1994, a cenotaph commemorating Dresden’s Shoah victims was unveiled at the cemetery (Fiedlerstrasse). The cemetery was desecrated several times in the 1990s and in 2010.

Duderstadt,see below,85 in 1900,27,"Although we do not know when Jews first settled in Duderstadt, records do tell us that the town was home to a synagogue in 1338 (and, possibly, a cemetery). Records from 1457 mention a school whose teacher also served as the chazzan and mohel. The modern community emerged in the 19th century, with most of its members engaged in trade and finance. Records suggest that services were conducted in prayer rooms until 1843. In 1898, the community inaugurated a synagogue—the building also accommodated a schoolroom and an apartment for a teacher who served as chazzan and shochet— on Christian Blank Strasse. Duderstadt’s new Jewish school was established in 1870. In 1920, a local branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith opened in Duderstadt. On Pogrom Night, Jewishowned properties were plundered; SS men set the defunct synagogue on fire, and four Jewish men were imprisoned temporarily. The remaining six Jews were eventually moved into one house; in 1942, the year during which the cemetery was leveled, they were deported. Later, in 1944 and 1945, 750 Jewish women from Hungary performed forced labor in Duderstadt. Three memorial stones were unveiled at the cemetery in 1953.

Duedelsheim,1596,136 in 1861,72,"By 1722, Jews in Duedelsheim were conducting services in a prayer room (located in a private residence).

Duedelsheim was home to a Jewish cemetery in the 17th century; in the late 1870s, the community consecrated larger burial grounds. The community also maintained a mikveh. In 1934, in response to dwindling population numbers, the community was dissolved. On Pogrom Night, SA men from Buedingen and local residents smashed the synagogue’s windows and furniture, after which they burned the debris and ritual objects in a meadow. Jewish homes were plundered, property was destroyed, and Jews were assaulted, one of whom, a 52-yearold woman, was dragged out of a bathroom, smeared with excrement and taken, together with her brother, to the marketplace, where they were forced to dance with a broom. All Jews were arrested that night, after which the women were freed and the men were sent to Buchenwald. Twenty-one Jews emigrated (13 of them went to the United States) and 50 relocated within Germany. Duedelsheim’s last two Jews moved to Frankfurt in May 1940. At least 19 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was demolished in the early 1950s.

Exactly one hundred years later, in 1759, Mr. Benjamin Moyses purchased the building, enlarged it and converted it into a proper synagogue. Moyses eventually donated that synagogue to the Jewish community. On June 10, 1898, the Jews of Duelken inaugurated a new synagogue; the building also housed a mikveh, a school and conference rooms. On Pogrom Night, SA officers burned down the synagogue, soon after which the rubble was removed and the site sold. Thanks to a prior warning, however, the Torah scrolls and other holy books had been removed from the synagogue and hidden in a private residence. Shortly before his deportation, Mr. Hermann Heymann, the Jewish community’s last surviving committee member, deposited the books with an Evangelist pastor for safekeeping. In 1948, the pastor gave the books to the newly formed Jewish community of Krefeld; and in 1964, the Torah scrolls found a home in Krefeld’s newly built synagogue.

Dueren,1241,358 in 1933,358,"The Jewish community of Dueren was decimated during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, but a Jewish presence was re-established there in 1370. In the mid-1880s, after two centuries during which large numbers of Jews settled in the area, more than 600 Jews lived in the Dueren region, approximately 10% of whom lived in the city of Dueren. Although the Jews of Dueren were not recognized as an official Jewish community, they maintained a prayer room and a school. In 1847, the authorities permitted the community to build a synagogue which would also serve the surrounding towns; and in 1869, construction commenced on the large house of worship (inaugurated in 1872). On Pogrom Night, SA troops tried to set the synagogue building on fire; they failed, and instead busied themselves by breaking windows, tearing the Torah scrolls and holy books and breaking furniture. Unappeased, the men returned the following morning, doused the building with kerosene and set it on fire, after which they did the same to the community center, the school building and the sexton�s house. According to records, the blaze was so intense that several neighboring homes caught fire, the inhabitants just managing to escape unharmed. The Dueren municipality billed the Jewish community for the cost of demolishing the synagogue ruins.

Duesseldorf,15th century,unknown (see below),,"Duesseldorf was home to a Jewish cemetery by 1418, indicating that Jews settled there in the 15th century. It was only at the end of the 17th century, however, when two wealthy Jewish families moved to Duesseldorf, that permanent Jewish settlement commenced. In 1890, 1,401 Jews lived in Duesseldorf, constituting the second-largest Jewish community in the North Rhine region. In 1712, an ancestor of Heinrich Heine established a Jewish prayer room on Neusser Street. Later, in 1787, the Jewish community purchased property on Kasernenstrasse and, in 1792, inaugurated a synagogue, the Old Synagogue, there; this house of worship was rebuilt in 1875, after which it was consecrated for the second time. In response to the fact that the city’s Jewish population experienced significant growth during the late 19th century, the community replaced its synagogue in 1904. The result, a neo-Romanesque building called the Great Synagogue, was equipped with an organ and seated over 1,000 worshipers. Rabbi Leo Baeck served the community until 1913, at which point Max Eschelbacher was hired as rabbi. In 1904, Duesseldorf’s Orthodox Jews began to conduct their own services in a prayer room on Bilker Strasse and, later, on Poststrasse; Eastern European Jews established additional prayer rooms. Other communal institutions included a school (opened in 1838) and at least four cemeteries: on Kasernenstrasse (1705-1884), Bongardstrasse (1788-1877), Alter Friedhof, Ulmenstrasse (1890-1922) and Neuer Friedhof, Ulmenstrasse (1922). In 1933, approximately 5,500 Jews resided in Duesseldorf. Records indicate that it was at this time that the community recorded its peak membership figure. Although we do not know how many children received religious instruction, records do tell us that up to 300 pupils attended the Jewish public school, established in 1935. The community also maintained a mikveh, branches of nationwide Jewish organizations, a home for apprentices and numerous charitable associations. Two local Jews were murdered by the Nazis in 1933 and 1937, respectively. On Pogrom Night, SA men torched the Great Synagogue, the school and several prayer rooms; Torah scrolls were set on fire, Jewish homes and stores were ransacked. Three Jews were murdered, several committed suicide and 70 were assaulted, seven of whom died of their injuries. We also know that 20 women and 166 men were arrested on Pogrom Night, after which, on November 16, 89 men were sent to Dachau. Many Duesseldorf Jews fled to neighboring countries, so that by May 1939, the city’s Jewish population had dropped to 1,831. Between 1941 and 1945, local Jews were deported to the ghettos and death camps of Eastern Europe. At least 2,213 Duesseldorf Jews were murdered in the Shoah. After the war, approximately 60 survivors returned to Duesseldorf, establishing a prayer room on Arnoldstrasse in 1948; and in 1958, a synagogue was inaugurated on Zietenstrasse. As of this writing, the Jewish community numbers 7,500 members, many of whom immigrated to Germany from the former Soviet Union. The former synagogue site—a memorial stone was unveiled there in 1983—now accommodates the Handelsblatt (commerce newspaper) Center. In 1987, a memorial center was opened in the townhouse on Muehlenstrasse.

Duisburg,1241,"1,805 in 1933","1,805","A small number of Jews lived in Duisburg in 1241, and had even established a synagogue there. During the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, the Jews of Duisburg suffered the fate shared by other Jews in Germany: murder. Thereafter, Jews were not permitted to live in Duisburg without special permission until the 17th century. A new Jewish presence was established in the city after the ban was lifted, but it was not until 1793 that the community opened a prayer room. The Industrial Revolution had a great impact on Duisburg. As it was an industrial city, laborers from all over Germany flocked there. So did Jews, and their numbers increased so much that by 1824 they had outgrown their prayer room. To alleviate the problem, the community leased a large warehouse and converted it into a synagogue with an adjacent mikveh. The synagogue building was adequate for several years, but by 1864 had deteriorated to such an extent that renovation was no longer an option. Instead, the community decided to build a new synagogue; construction commenced in 1871, and in March 1875, the synagogue was inaugurated. A magnificent structure, its architectural style combined Romanesque, Gothic and Classical features. The dome at its center was visible from afar. Duisburg was also home to a substantial Orthodox community. Known as Machzikeh Hadas, this community conducted services in a modest synagogue and maintained its own school and mikveh. During the early 1920s, the Jews of Duisburg began to suffer from isolated anti-Semitic incidents. The situation worsened with every passing year; by 1933, vandalism, harassment and assault had become routine. On Pogrom Night, shortly after midnight, SS troops broke into the synagogue, plundered it and set it on fire. They also incinerated the community center, the rabbi’s residence and the Machzikeh Hadas synagogue. Both synagogues were torn down in early 1939. Later, a home for the disabled was built on the site of the larger house of worship. A memorial plaque, commemorating the Jews of Duisburg and their history, has been unveiled on the street corner on which the synagogue once stood.","Moshe Finkel Sources: LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=388,388
Duisburg-Ruhrort,17th century,520 in 1910,,"Several Jewish families settled in Duisburg-Ruhrort in the 17th century. The Jewish population experienced considerable growth in the 19th century, peaking at 520 in 1910. Community members conducted services in a private residence—the house also accommodated a schoolroom—until August 13, 1841, when a synagogue was inaugurated at 21 Landwehrstrasse. At the community center, located in front of the synagogue, a school and an apartment for its teacher were built in 1843. Enlarged in 1751, the Jewish cemetery on Rheinbrueckenstrasse/Rheinallee served the community from 1730 until 1894; the new cemetery on Beeck was consecrated in 1893. In 1933, 150 Jews resided in Duisburg-Ruhrort; twentynine schoolchildren received religious instruction. Two Jewish welfare associations—one for men, the other for women—provided services to the sick and indigent. A Jewish youth league was active in the community. The synagogue was heavily damaged in the pogrom of November 9-10, 1938; local Jewish men were sent to Dachau. By February 1939, the synagogue ruins had been torn down; and in September 1939, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into a so-called Judenhaus (“Jews’ house”). At least 34 Duisburg-Ruhrort Jews were murdered in the Shoah.

Duisburg-Hamborn,1893,818 in 1925,685,"It was not until 1893 that a Jewish presence was established in Hamborn (which was joined with the city of Duisburg in 1929). When, in 1899, the Jewish community numbered 51 members, attempts were made to build a synagogue. Stymied by city officials who refused to grant the necessary permits, the community decided, instead, to abandon the idea and set up a prayer room in a private residence. In 1905, local Jews were permitted to take over a vacant Evangelical church on Kaiser-Friedrich- Strasse, which they renovated and converted into a synagogue. Several years later, the community purchased a property on which they planned to build a new synagogue; forced to abandon the plan when the economy plummeted and the likelihood of war increased, local Jews decided to refurbish the synagogue on Kaiser-Friedrich-Strasse. The Orthodox members of the community built their own synagogue on Kaiser- Willhelm- Strasse. Membership there increased quickly, and the congregation was forced to rent an auditorium to accommodate those who wished to attend High Holiday services. Although the synagogue on Kaiser-Friedrich- Strasse was sold (on November 1, 1938) to a private citizen who intended to convert the building into apartments, the SS nevertheless incinerated the house of worship on Pogrom Night, undeterred by the fact that its new owner was a German citizen. A memorial plaque was unveiled at the site in 1988. We do not know what happened to the synagogue on Kaiser-Wilhelm-Strasse.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=389,389
Eberbach,13th century,138 in 1900,39,"A Jewish community formed in Eberbach during the late 1600s, but it was not until 1832, when five families hired a teacher, that the community received official status. The Eberbach Jews established a prayer hall in the 1840s, a synagogue in 1860, a cemetery in 1891, and also a school at some point during the 1800s. A new synagogue—the congregation also maintained a mikveh—was inaugurated in Eberbach in 1913. In 1933, the teacher (he also served as a chazzan and shochet) instructed nine pupils in religion. That same year, Nazis arrested a local Jew accused of being a Communist; he eventually died in a concentration camp. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down: holy books and Torah scrolls were “secured” by police, Jewish-owned businesses were wrecked and six Jewish men were detained, two of whom ended up in Dachau. Fifteen Eberbach Jews escaped the country, three relocated within Germany, two died in Eberbach, and 17 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. Only one Jewish woman, who had married a Christian, was spared deportation. At least 40 Eberbach Jews perished in the Shoah.

Ebersheim,mid-18th century,82 in 1871,25,"In 1844, the Ebersheim Jewish community inaugurated a synagogue at 7 Mainzer Strasse (present-day 6 Konrad Adenauer Strasse). Ebersheim’s Jewish cemetery, established near Zornheim in the first half of the 19th century, also served the affiliated community of Harzheim. In the mid- 19th century the Jews of Ebersheim employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan; later, when community membership began to dwindle, schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from Hechtsheim. In 1933, when 25 Jews lived in Ebersheim, synagogue services were held only on Shabbat and holidays. On Pogrom Night, 1938—13 Jews lived in Ebersheim that year—Nazis set fire to the synagogue, destroying the interior, and heavily damaged five Jewish homes. During the Nazi period, eight Ebersheim Jews emigrated from Germany and 17 relocated within the country. In January 1940, the remaining Jewish residents left for Mainz, from where they were deported to Theresienstadt in 1941. At least eight Ebersheim Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1956, the former synagogue building was demolished.

The community maintained an elementary school from the first half of the 19th century until 1924, after which a teacher who served as chazzan and shochet instructed Jewish schoolchildren in religion. Burials were conducted in Alsbach, but the community was able to maintain its own mikveh. By the late 1920s, services were conducted in the synagogue only on the High Holidays. The community was disbanded in 1937. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. Troops of local Nazis, SA men and Hitler Youth vandalized Jewish homes, destroyed property and tortured Jews. One man died of his injuries in February 1939; an 81-year-old woman was killed for refusing to be detained by a local Nazi leader. Thirty-five Jews emigrated (30 went to the United States), 18 relocated within Germany, three were murdered in Eberstadt and four, the last, were deported to Theresienstadt in 1942.

Eberswalde,14th century,270 in 1928,192,"The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Eberswalde is from the 14th century. The expulsion in 1510 of Jews from the Brandenburg region brought this early settlement to an end, and it was not until 1696 that Jews were permitted to return to Eberswalde. The modern community established a prayer room on Rosenstrasse (present-day Kreuzstrasse) in 1720; a synagogue was erected on the same site in 1820. In 1890, as a result of growing Jewish population numbers, a Moorishstyle synagogue was built at 9 Bismarckstrasse; the festive inauguration ceremony took place in December 1891. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Oderberger Strasse in 1751, prior to which burials had been conducted in Biesenthal. According to records, the cemetery was enlarged in 1851 and desecrated in 1897. We also know that, in 1911/13, the community purchased new cemetery grounds on Freienwalder Strasse (they had been opened by 1924). Destroyed by lightning in 1931, the synagogue was rebuilt in 1932. In 1933, 192 Jews lived in Eberswalde; twenty-one schoolchildren attended a school for religious studies. Active in the community were a chevra kadisha (founded in 1909), three welfare organizations—a fund for the poor, a Gmillus Chassodim society and a Jewish women’s association—as well as a Jewish history and literature club. In March 1933, Jewish-owned stores were daubed with anti-Jewish slogans; shop windows were smeared with paint. Five years later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), local members of the Nazi Party and the SA set fire to the synagogue, vandalized Jewish-owned stores and homes and assaulted Jews, one of whom died of his injuries. According to records, the Jewish community’s leader of sermons was taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In May 1939, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into “Jews’ houses” on Kirchstrasse and Schneiderstrasse; and in 1942, they were deported to ghettos and camps in Eastern Europe. At least 48 Eberswalde Jews perished in the Shoah. The newer cemetery was desecrated after the war. A memorial plaque has been unveiled on Bismarckstrasse (present-day Goethestrasse), and two streets have been named after former Jewish residents.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn; Sources: AJ.

Edenkoben,,200 in 1850,66,"Beginning in 1660, Jews were continuously present in Edenkoben. Jewish communal institutions included a synagogue (established in 1780-81), a new synagogue (1827), a mikveh, and a school building (1830), the last of which was adjacent to the synagogue. Jewish schoolteachers also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet; Maier Elsasser held this post between 1830 and 1865, followed by Leopold Stern, Josef Weil and then David Baer. Various reforms, for example, the playing of a harmonium and the use of German as a language for prayer, were introduced at the synagogue. The congregants, mostly cattle dealers and shopkeepers, also maintained a flourishing charity association. Several local Jews served in the army during World War I, and four died in combat; later, during the Nazi period, their names were removed from the town’s war memorial. Many Edenkoben Jews emigrated from Germany after the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933. On Pogrom Night, windows in Jewish-owned homes were smashed; at the synagogue, Nazis destroyed the interior, after which the contents, including the Torah scrolls, were burned in the marketplace as a local Nazi band played celebratory music. Approximately 14 Jews were left to be deported. The synagogue site was later rebuilt for commercial and residential purposes.","Harold Slutzkin Sources: AJ, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=397,397

One hundred years later, seven Jewish families lived on Rathausstrasse (nicknamed Judengasse, or “Jews’ Alley”). These Jewish families, together with those of neighboring Eller, Bremm and Nehren, were largely responsible for the community’s very modest population growth. The synagogue, established during the community’s early years, was located in a private residence on the so-called Judengasse. In the mid-1800s, a new synagogue was erected in Ediger; built in the Neo-Gothic architectural style, that house of worship was renovated in 1888/90 to include a women’s gallery and a street entrance. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 financially crippled Ediger’s few remaining Jewish shop owners, and most emigrated from Germany. On Pogrom Night, rioters broke windows in the synagogue and vandalized the interior, after which the few remaining Jews were deported.

Eighty-six Jews lived in Edelfingen in 1933; six children studied religion with a teacher/chazzan. A chevra kadisha, a women’s association and a charity association were active in Edelfingen that year. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was broken into and its ritual objects destroyed. A Jewish home was damaged heavily, and nine Jews were sent to Dachau. Five Jewish babies were born in Edelfingen after 1933. Sixty-three local Jews emigrated, eight died in Edelfingen and 10 relocated within Germany. The remaining 10 Jews were eventually deported to the East. According to records, at least 20 Edelfingen Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was destroyed in a 1945 bombing raid.

(The town was home to a Jewish dentist in the mid-1700s.) The early community maintained a school, a mikveh and a prayer room, the last of which was, presumably, used until 1798, when the community dedicated a synagogue on Baustrasse and re-consecrated the medieval cemetery on Judenkirchhofsfeld. In 1896, a new synagogue was inaugurated on Bismarckstrasse; sold in 1906, the old house of worship became a residential building. Einbeck’s new Jewish cemetery, consecrated on Rabbethgenstrasse in 1832, was used until 1911, when the community began to bury its dead in the central cemetery. The Jews of Einbeck also maintained an orphanage for girls, a social and sports club, two Jewish associations (one for men, the other for women) and a charitable organization. On Pogrom Night, Jewish properties were plundered and demolished, Jews were arrested and the synagogue was burned to the ground by non-local SS men. By 1939, only nine Jews lived in Einbeck.

Although a Jewish school was established in Einartshausen at some point between 1752 and 1766, the presence of a teacher was sporadic. Later, as the Jewish population began to dwindle, the community received aid from neighboring Schotten. We also know that the Jews of Einartshausen belonged to the Liberal synagogue community of Giessen. In 1924, the leaders of the community were Brodreich, Essinger and Goldschmidt.

Eisenach,1241,,,"Eisenach’s first Jewish settlement, established in the Middle Ages, had its own “Judenstrasse” or “Jews’ street”; its residents were driven out during the Black Death persecutions of 1348- 1349. Jews did return to the town in later years, but were expelled again in 1458. The town’s modern Jewish community began to develop in the early 1800s; its members established a cemetery and, at 23 Karlstrasse, a prayer hall. The Eisenach Jewish congregation was officially constituted in 1867, with 72 members. By the late 1800s, it had grown to such an extent (300 members) that services for the High Holidays had to be held at the Loewen Hotel. A new, larger house of worship became imperative; construction work began in 1883, and a new synagogue was inaugurated on today’s Karl Marx Strasse in January 1885. Even though Eisenach’s young Jewish men staunchly played their part in defending the Fatherland (23 fell in World War I) anti-Semitic incidents took place frequently in the town in the 1920s, and the synagogue’s windows were often smashed. In 1933, the boycott of Jewish businesses destroyed whatever sense of security Eisenach’s Jews still had, and they began to leave. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, the synagogue was burned down. All the town’s Jewish businesses, most of its Jewish-owned homes and the Jewish cemetery were destroyed. Approximately one third of the Jews who left Eisenach during that period managed to escape to safe places. In 1941, the 145 Jews who remained were gathered together to live in several so-called “Jews’ houses,” and were then deported in stages; few survived. In 1947, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the site of the former synagogue; in 1998, a new memorial was dedicated to those who were deported, never to return.","Harold Slutzkin Sources: AJ, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=405,405

Between 1827 and 1830, the Eiterfeld Jewish community built a new synagogue with 52 seats for men and 24 for women. Eiterfeld was home to a Jewish school, presided over by teachers who also performed the duties of cantors and ritual slaughterers, from 1861 until 1933. The community, which was affiliated with the Jewish community in Buchenau, used the cemeteries in Burghaun or Erdmannrode. Eleven children studied religion in Eiterfeld in 1924. In 1932, 40 Jews, led by Max Lomnitz, lived in Eiterfeld. When a Jewish public school was opened in Burghaun in 1937—at which point only two Jewish families lived in Eiterfeld— the few Jewish schoolchildren left in Eiterfeld attended classes there. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night. In 1942, Buchenau’s five remaining Jews were deported to Theresienstadt, where two died; the other three perished in Auschwitz, Minsk and Buchenwald. Approximately 33 Jewish residents of Eiterfeld and 18 of Buchenau perished in the Shoah. A memorial plaque was unveiled in Eiterfeld in 2005. In 2008, three local youths removed the plaque and threw it away; they were caught, and the plaque was reaffixed.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=407,407
Eitorf,,unknown,unknown,"The first Jewish family to settle in Eitorf arrived in the decade between 1810 and 1820; thereafter a small Jewish community developed. Although Jewish population figures are not available for this town, we can assume they were always low. Eitorf’s Jews became a designated, “special” community, affiliated with the larger Jewish community in nearby Uckerath, in 1863. They were affiliated with the congregation in Geistingen in 1887. In 1893 the Eitorf community established a prayer hall in a residence on today’s Krabach-Talstrasse (formerly 10 Leienbergstrasse); the house of worship was inaugurated by Rabbi Falk Cohn, from Bonn, on June 16 that year. Owing to an increase in the town’s Jewish population, a larger prayer room was opened—it too was inaugurated by Rabbi Cohn, assisted by the cantor, Mr. Rosenbaum-Geistingen—in the same building in 1921. This new prayer room was open all the Jews of the joint Eitorf-Geistingen community. It was also used by many guests from out of town, including those who came to Eitorf to visit its spas. The prayer room was on the ground floor; a non-Jewish family lived on the floor above it. There is no mention of a mikveh. Discontent grew among Eitorf’s Jews, who felt they did not receive much in return for the fees they paid to the community authorities in Geistingen; therefore, from the year 1915 onwards, they sought independent status. They did manage to open their own cemetery in 1918, but were definitively refused independence in 1919. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, the windows and interior of the prayer room in Eitorf were destroyed; the cost of the damage came to between 400 and 500 Reichsmarks. In 1939 the owner of the building carried out renovations, replacing the glass in the three windows and installing some larger windows too. Presumably, any Jews who remained in Eitorf after Pogrom Night were deported to the camps. As of this writing, Eitorf does not have a memorial for the town’s former Jewish house of worship, but a commemorative “stumbling stone” has been installed, listing former residents of the town who became victims of the Shoah. According to Yad Vashem, at least 25 Eitorf Jews perished during those years.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: SG-NRW, SIA, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=408,408
Eisleben,14th century,138 in 1854,85,"Eisleben’s 14th-century Jewish community lived in a ghetto called the Judendorf, or “Jews’ village,” near the town’s marketplace. Jews were temporarily expelled from the town in the 15th century; later, in the mid-16th century, Count von Mansfeld banished them once again. Nevertheless, a new Jewish community was founded in Eisleben at some point during the Napoleonic period (either in 1812 or in 1814), around which time a synagogue and a Jewish cemetery were established on Lutherstrasse, not far from the birthplace of Martin Luther. The Jewish community of Eisleben became the main community for the entire local district in 1857, and it was during the 1950s that a new house of worship was built on the site of Eisleben’s previous synagogue; the ground floor of the new building housed a school for religious studies and lodgings for the teacher. A new Jewish cemetery, at 6 Magdeburger Strasse, was consecrated in 1877. Jews were physically attacked in Eisleben during the Naziled boycott of Jewish businesses in 1933. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, rioters vandalized the cemetery and Jewish-owned homes and shops. The synagogue was not torched because of its proximity to a row of houses, but its interior was destroyed. Four Jewish men were deported to Buchenwald. The synagogue was sold in 1939, after which the Jews of Eisleben were affiliated with the Jewish community in Halle. In 1941, the 17 Jews who remained were forcibly moved into communal accommodation in a so-called “Judenhaus,” or “Jews’ house”. In 1942, Eisleben’s remaining Jews were deported to Theresienstadt. At least 24 Eisleben Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial plaque, bearing an engraving of the Shema prayer in Hebrew and in German, has been unveiled near the Market Church, and a street sign that reads “Juedenhof” or “Jews’ courtyard” marks the site of the former Jewish quarter in the old part of town.","Beate Grosz-Wenker, Fred Gottlieb Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, SUN, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=406,406
Ellar,1635/36,35 in 1895,unknown,"The Jewish community of Ellar (present-day Waldbrunn) was founded in 1740. In 1843, the combined Jewish population of Ellar and its affiliated communities (Hausen, Lahr and Waldernbach) was 124. Beginning in the early 18th century, Joseph Liebmann’s house on Bornweg was used as a synagogue. The community maintained a mikveh, a cemetery on Am Oberholz/Lahrweg (1731-1937) and a Jewish school. In 1875, a teacher by the name of Schloss instructed children in religion. The synagogue was seldom used after 1885, when the Jews of nearby Frickhofen and Langendernbach began conducting their own services. The leaders of the community in 1932 were Theodor and Louis Liebmann. Sixteen Jews lived in Ellar in 1933, and two children studied religion that year (probably with a teacher from out of town). On Pogrom Night, as Jews hid in the village leader’s house, Nazis ravaged the synagogue, the cemetery and private Jewish properties. Thirteen Jews, Ellar’s last, fled after Pogrom Night, after which the synagogue—defunct since 1933—was torn down. At least 18 Jewish residents of Ellar perished in the Shoah. A large memorial plaque was later unveiled at the entrance to the Jewish cemetery.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=411,411
Elbing,1350,549 in 1871,367,"The earliest known record of a Jewish presence in Elbing (present-day Elbag, Poland) mentions the Black Death pogroms of 1350, when Jews fleeing western and southern Germany settled in the town. Although Jews were officially forbidden from residing and working in Elbing, some were allowed to maintain property. Records from the late 18th century provide evidence of an established Jewish community. In 1824, the community consecrated a synagogue (160 seats) and a ritual bath. Elbing was home to a Jewish school, established in the 19th century, and we also know that beginning in 1875, the community employed its own rabbis; the last acting rabbi was Dr. Siegberg Neufeld, who immigrated to Palestine in 1939. During the 1860s, in response to growing population numbers, the community enlarged the synagogue and built a new community center. By 1880, 549 Jews lived in Elbing. Loeser & Wolff, Elbing’s Jewish-owned cigar factory, was among the leading industrial concerns in Prussia, employing in 1926 some 4,000 people. Four hundred and sixty Jews lived in Elbing when the Nazis came to power, and they continued to organize a wide range of cultural events under increasingly hostile conditions. Many Elbing Jews later left for larger cities or emigrated from Germany. On Pogrom Night, nearly all of the remaining Jewish men were arrested; Jewish-owned shops were destroyed, and the synagogue was torched after the sacred objects had been stolen.","Fred Gottlieb Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=409,409
Ellingen,1542,103 in 1880,,"The modern Jewish community of Ellingen inaugurated a synagogue in 1759. The building housed a mikveh and living quarters for the community’s teacher, who also functioned as chazzan and shochet. Burials were conducted in Treuchtlingen. In 1932, eight children studied religion in Ellingen. Branches of Agudat Israel and the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active in Ellingen that year. Beginning in 1938, Ellingen’s mayor refused to issue trading licenses to Jews. In September or October of that year, the town’s few remaining Jews sold their synagogue for a nominal price. On Pogrom Night, the mayor, a member of the Nazi Party since 1919, led a group of six SS men from Wissenburg to Ellingen’s two remaining Jewish homes. The attackers broke into these houses and destroyed everything inside; they also destroyed the synagogue’s furniture and remaining ritual objects. Nine Ellingen Jews immigrated to the United States or to Palestine; sixteen moved to other German cities. At least 17 Ellingen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1945, some of the synagogue’s ritual objects were found in a barn belonging to a local Nazi, but these later disappeared.

Eldagsen,15th century,57 in 1880 and 1905,52,"When this Jewish community peaked in 1880, most Eldagsen Jews earned a living as cattle traders, butchers and peddlers; later, local Jews also became craftspeople, merchants and bankers. The community consecrated a cemetery (on Gehlenbach) in 1753 and a small synagogue in 1814, the latter of which was erected on the grounds of a private Jewish residence. Records from 1844 mention a rented schoolroom, and we also know that a local mikveh closed in 1866. Finally, in 1868, the community built a new synagogue on Lange Strasse; the building also accommodated a school and an apartment for a teacher who served as chazzan and shochet. Jews were active in the town’s political and social life. Eldagsen was home to a local branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith. The Nazis’ anti-Jewish legislation was zealously enforced in Eldagsen, so that, by 1937, most local Jews had either emigrated or relocated within Germany. On Pogrom Night, members of the SS and SA desecrated the cemetery and damaged the synagogue’s interior; Jewish properties were vandalized and looted, and the remaining Jewish men were assaulted and sent to Buchenwald. The synagogue building—it had been sold in 1940—was converted into a church in 1948 and, in the late 1950s, into a residential building. Memorials were unveiled at the cemetery and at the public park in 1953 and 1995, respectively.

Ellrich,14th century,146 in 1840,14,"Records indicate that Ellrich’s modern Jewish community emerged in 1701. During the 18th century and the first half of the 19th, the arrival of Jews from nearby Nordhausen triggered an increase in the Jewish population. The community, most of whose members were small shopkeepers, acquired a cemetery in 1785; earlier, in 1730 it had already built a synagogue on the Judengasse (“Jews’ Alley”) with space for 50 men and 30 women. (The street still exists under the same name.) After World War I, the Jewish population began to dwindle, so that by 1938 only two Jewish families and three unmarried Jews remained in Ellrich. The synagogue, used only sporadically during the years leading up to November 1938, was incinerated on Pogrom Night. The few remaining Jews were arrested and taken to Nordhausen. In 1988, a plaque was erected on the Judengasse commemorating “The Jewish Community: 1591-1938.”","Harold Slutzkin Sources: LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=413,413
Elmshorn,late 17th century,,55,"In 1749, after the authorities in Elmshorn finally granted Jews permission to conduct prayer services outside of private homes, a synagogue was inaugurated on Flamweg; a new synagogue was built on the same site in 1846. Elmshorn’s cemetery, consecrated on leased land in 1685, was purchased by the community in 1868. We also know that, in 1837, a Jewish elementary school—the community had hired teachers since 1685—was established in Elmshorn; following a government decision in 1893, however, the school limited its curriculum to religious studies. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down, a Jewish apartment was destroyed and all but two Jewish men, both of whom were sick, were sent to the Sachsenhausen camp. The synagogue site was sold to the municipality in March 1939. Several Jews moved to Elmshorn after 1933. Thirty-three Jews emigrated, 28 relocated within Germany, three were deported to the East in 1941 and one committed suicide before the deportation. The community was officially disbanded in April 1941, after which, in 1944, the cemetery became the property of the district of Pinneberg; it was later destroyed. At least four Elmshorn Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue ruins were cleared after the war, and a memorial was erected on the site in 1981; the destroyed cemetery has been renovated.

At some point during the 18th century, a prayer room was set up inside Enoch Abraham’s house. Beginning in 1831, however, the community conducted services in a synagogue—it was owned by the rabbinate in Wiesbaden—on Schwalbacher Strasse. Local Jews maintained a mikveh and a school for religious studies, and we also know that burials were conducted in Mainz until 1847, after which the community used the cemetery in Oestrich; in 1895, Eltville Jews finally consecrated their own cemetery on Schwalbacher Strasse. In 1932, the community leaders were Leopold Bach and Eduard Rosenthal. Eleven children studied religion under the guidance of Mr. Katzenstein, a teacher from Schierstein. Three Eltville Jews passed away in 1933. Ten or twelve managed to emigrate between 1933 and 1938; eight resettled elsewhere in Germany. On Pogrom Night, SA men ravaged the synagogue’s interior. Six Jews still lived in Eltville in 1939, all of whom were deported. At least 20 former residents of Eltville perished in the Shoah. Numbers for Kiedrich (an affiliated community) are not available.

In 1866 or 1867, prior to which prayer services had been conducted in a private residence, the Jewish community purchased a building on Neffetalstrasse (formerly Kirschlandstrasse) and converted it into a synagogue; in the adjacent house, which was also owned by the community, the synagogue’s caretaker lived free of charge. We also know that Embken’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1884, and that the congregation belonged to the district synagogue association of Dueren. Anti-Semitic violence erupted in Embken as early as 1935. Later, on November 10, 1938, SA men ravaged the synagogue; a boy removed the Star of David from the roof. Using straw from Theo Classen’s barn as fuel, the rioters set fire to the building, which burned down to its foundations. Outside, SA men burned the Torah scrolls and ritual objects. Kahn’s house was ravaged on Pogrom Night, and the Schwarz family home was set on fire. Seven local Jews were deported to the East at the outset of the war. According to Yad Vashem, at least 34 Embken Jews perished in the Shoah. As a result of post-war vandalism, the Am Muehlberg cemetery now has only 26 gravestones.

Emden,16th century,809 in 1905,581,"Although the first Jews to live in Emden were Sephardim, the Jewish community that later developed was mainly Ashkenazi. In 1905, the year in which the community recorded a peak population figure, most members were cattle and used-goods traders, butchers, moneylenders, merchants and physicians. Emden, which always had its own rabbi, eventually became the district rabbinate. In 1836, the community replaced its synagogue (on Judenstrasse or “Jews’ Street”) with a new building; it was enlarged in 1910 to include a mikveh, as well as 320 seats for men and 250 for women. A Jewish school was established near the synagogue in 1845, prior to which children were either tutored privately or attended a charity school. Emden Jews maintained numerous Jewish associations: six charities, 16 smaller associations and sick funds, a home for the elderly, a women’s association, youth clubs and literary circles. The chevra kadisha and Talmud Torah Association were founded in 1661 and 1896, respectively. Jews were also active in local trade associations. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, 581 Jews still lived in the town; the Nazis’ anti-Semitic legislation was immediately enforced. On Pogrom Night, SA men burned down the synagogue; some ritual objects were stolen, others were saved. Jewish properties were vandalized and looted, Jews were arrested and publicly humiliated, and one man was killed. We also know that Jewish men were deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp that night, where two died.

In 1907, the community inaugurated a synagogue on 5 Wilhelmstrasse; the brick building accommodated approximately 50 worshipers, a balcony for women and a mikveh. Although the Jews of Epe were not able to hire a teacher or a cantor, it is likely that religious education was provided by the district rabbinate of Muenster, to which the community belonged. Burials were probably conducted in Gronau, where a Jewish cemetery had been consecrated in 1828. On Pogrom Night, SA men ravaged the synagogue and set the building on fire. Jewish homes were also damaged, and Jews were assaulted. Reports mention a Jewish woman, who had been treated thus and whose husband had been arrested, pleading for help, but to no avail, for her non-Jewish friends feared reprisals.

Erfurt,9th century,831 in 1933,,"Although records mention a temporary Jewish presence in Erfurt during the 9th century, the famous medieval community did not take shape until the second half of the 12th century. This community maintained two synagogues, a yeshiva and a mikveh, the last of which has recently attracted much scholarly attention. The massacre of 1223 was later commemorated by a fast day, as recorded in the memorial book of the Mainz Jewish community. The city, twice chosen as the venue for regional rabbinical synods, produced shofars for the whole of Germany. The Black Death pogroms of 1348/49 decimated the large community (976 members), and although the survivors attempted to reestablish themselves soon afterwards, their descendants were expelled in 1453/54. It was not until 1768 that Jews were allowed to live or trade in the city again. The modern community was founded in the early 19th century, soon after which it consecrated a cemetery; religious services were conducted in a private residence. In 1823, the community built a synagogue—it also housed a mikveh—but by the end of the 1830s the congregation’s increasing wealth and growing membership necessitated the construction of a new structure. Accordingly, a modern synagogue was inaugurated with much fanfare in 1840 and consecrated by Rabbi Dr. Phillipson of Magdeburg. When this synagogue, too, was deemed insufficient for the swelling congregation of 450 members, the community built (in 1884) the Great Synagogue, consecrated by Rabbi Dr. Kroner and Rabbi Dr. Karo. The presence of an organ and the proposed inclusion of women in the choir, however, forced a number of Orthodox families to secede from the community and establish their own synagogue. Notwithstanding this and other examples of religious disagreements, the community prospered, boasting factory owners, doctors, lawyers, town councilors and several national politicians. Erfurt was also home to a chevra kadisha, women’s charity committees and cultural societies. The Jewish community of 1933 included a number of Polish immigrants. Jewish businesses were boycotted that year, and emigration from Germany began in earnest. The weakened community suffered another blow when, in October of 1938, the Polish Jews were deported to the East. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire; Jewish premises were vandalized, and many householders were arrested and assaulted. Erfurt’s remaining 188 Jews were deported in stages during the war. After the war, a new community of 129 members established itself in Erfurt and built a new synagogue. For many years the second-largest Jewish community (after Berlin) in the German Democratic Republic, it numbered only 30 members by 1988. The reunification of Germany, however, generated much interest in the medieval synagogue, mikveh and surviving religious artifacts and Hebrew manuscripts.","Harold Slutzkin Sources: AJ, EJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=424,424
Erkelenz,1852,unknown,unknown,"In 1852, a Jewish tanner named Jacob Kaufman settled in Erkelenz. Within nine years, the Jewish population was 18. Use of the community’s first synagogue, built on Oerather Strasse in 1862, was short-lived, for in 1869 the Jews of Erkelenz inaugurated a new synagogue on Patersgasse (also accessed from Westpromenade). An aerial photograph shows a saddle-roofed, brick building of 28 by 26 square feet. In Erkelenz, a Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Neusser Strasse. In April 1933, the boycott of Jewish-owned business was implemented in Erkelenz. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), SS and SA men demolished the synagogue and Jewish homes. According to an eyewitness who was then eight years old, Jews who attempted to enter the synagogue and rescue the books and ritual objects were arrested, never to be seen again. Between 30 and 40 Jews lived in Erkelenz at the beginning of World War II. On April 1, 1941, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved from so-called “Jews’ Houses” to Spiesshof (in Hetzerath), from where they were deported to concentration camps, via the Izbica ghetto, in 1942. At least 44 Erkelenz Jews perished in the Shoah. Only two Jews (a married couple) returned to Erkelenz after the Shoah. At the synagogue site, now a restaurant, one can still discern sections of what was once the back wall.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: SG-NRW, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=425,425
Erlangen,1408,239 in 1890,130,"The Jews of Erlangen established a community and a prayer hall in 1873, a new prayer hall in 1878 and a cemetery in 1891. Twelve pupils studied religion in Erlangen in 1933. That year, the community was operating three Jewish associations and a kosher canteen for Jewish university students. In 1937, the diminished community moved to a smaller prayer room at 5 Einhornstrasse. On Pogrom Night, rioters wrecked the prayer room and confiscated its ritual objects and Torah scrolls. All Jews were arrested that night: the men were held in Nuremberg prison for six weeks; the women and children were kept in a hostel for three days. After the men were released, they were forced to sell their plundered houses for a fraction of their actual value. In May 1939, the cemetery was destroyed. Forty-two Erlangen Jews emigrated, 50 relocated within Germany and eight died in Erlangen (one of whom committed suicide). In November 1941, six Erlangen Jews were deported to Riga; and in October 1943, the town’s last Jewish person, a woman, was deported to Auschwitz. At least 80 Erlangen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1983, a memorial stone was unveiled at the cemetery.

Erlenbach,1760,63 in 1863 (14% of the total population),25,"Jews first settled in Erlenbach in 1760, after which the Jewish population experienced modest growth. Although we do not know when this small community established its prayer hall (located in a Jewish residence), mikveh and schoolroom, records do tell us that a synagogue—which would, generally speaking, have housed the schoolroom and mikveh—was built in Erlenbach in 1842. Burials were conducted in nearby Busenburg, whose Jewish community shared the expense of employing a teacher/chazzan/shochet. The majority of local Jews earned a living through agriculture and related commerce. According to records, four Erlenbach Jews died during World War I. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 triggered an exodus from the district. Later, in October of 1938 (one month before Pogrom Night), local Nazis broke the windows of the remaining Jewish homes and destroyed the synagogue’s interior. The handful of Jews who did not manage to escape after the outbreak of World War II were deported to and perished in the camps. The destroyed synagogue was torn down in 1948.","Harold Slutzkin Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=427,427
Ermershausen,unknown,111 in 1814,58,"The Jewish community of Ermershausen, founded during the second half of the 18th century, established a cemetery in 1832. In 1850, the community built a synagogue. (The building also housed an apartment for the schoolteacher, a mikveh and a classroom.) David Kissinger (grandfather of Henry Kissinger) was Ermershausen’s Jewish schoolteacher during the 19th century. Jews’ relations with their Christian neighbors were good in Ermershausen, a fact that helps explain why only 10 Jews left the town before 1938. In 1934, however, the Jewish schoolteacher was arrested and imprisoned for several months on a blood libel charge invented by the Gestapo in Burgpreppach. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was destroyed, as was furniture in Jewish homes. Jews were forced to burn the Torah scrolls in a field outside the village; most of the men were deported to Dachau. By 1941, 25 Ermershausen Jews had immigrated to the United States and 13 had relocated in Germany. In April 1942, 15 of the remaining 18 Jews were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg). That same year (in June), Ermershausen’s last three Jews were sent to the Jewish oldage home in Schweinfurt, from which they were deported to Theresienstadt in September 1942. The synagogue building survived the war and was later converted into a residence.","Magret Liat Wolf Sources: AJ, PK BAV rijo-research.de www.math.rutger.edu/~zeilberg/family/omalea.pdf",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=428,428
Ermreuth,1554,194 in 1822,21,"The newly-founded Jewish community of Ermreuth established a cemetery in 1711 and a synagogue in 1738. The cemetery was enlarged in 1797 and in 1862, and a new, larger synagogue was built in 1823. Ermreuth was home to a Jewish elementary school presided over by teachers who also performed the duties of cantors and ritual slaughterers; beginning in 1914, however, the teacher offered religious instruction only. The community also maintained its own mikveh. In 1931, the community, unable to gather a minyan, asked the Bavarian Jewish Association to send three men to Ermreuth. The schoolteacher from nearby Erlangen, however, was still instructing three Ermreuth schoolchildren in 1933. The synagogue’s interior and ritual objects were destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were Jewish homes. Max Wasserstein was beaten so severely by a local Nazi that he eventually died, in Nuremberg, of his injuries. During the Nazi era, six Ermreuth Jews emigrated, 15 relocated within Germany and two died in Ermreuth. The last 15, forced to move to Nuremberg in 1939, were deported to the extermination camps in 1942. At least 21 Ermreuth Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1994, the synagogue was reopened as a cultural center.

Eschwege,13th century,549 in 1885,421,"Jews were persecuted in Eschwege in 1295 and, records indicate, during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. The re-established Jewish community, home to a district rabbinate, founded the following institutions: a synagogue and mikveh in 1692 (at 20 Unter dem Berge); a yeshiva in 1727; an elementary school in 1827; a new synagogue—134 seats for men, 74 for women—in 1838 (at 4 Vor dem Berge); a new school in 1839 (at 3 Schulstrasse); and, finally, a cemetery in 1853 (consecrated near Elsa Brandstroem Strasse). We also know that Eschwege’s Orthodox Jews formed their own minyan in 1858, and that the synagogue was renovated in 1925. Forty pupils received religious instruction in 1932; in 1933, 28 children attended the Jewish school. Dr. Heinrich Bassfreund was rabbi, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community. Windows in a Jewish-owned business were smashed in 1936, Jewish children were assaulted in 1937 and a Jewish teacher was arrested in 1938. Eschwege’s Jewish school closed in 1939. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, Jewish homes were ransacked and Jewish men were paraded through the streets before being deported to Buchenwald, where four died. After the pogrom, the municipality used the synagogue building as a depot. In 1939, the remaining Jews (including those who were sent to Eschwege from other communities) were moved to so-called “Jews’ Houses.” Two hundred and twenty-two Eschwege Jews emigrated, approximately 190 moved to other German cities, 36 passed away in Eschwege and two committed suicide. In 1941/42, 109 Jews were deported. At least 190 Eschwege Jews perished in the Shoah. After World War II, Displaced Persons (they were housed in a local DP camp) and Jewish returnees from the camps conducted services in the synagogue. Closed down after the last of these left the area in 1948, the synagogue was converted into a New Apostolic Church in 1954. Several memorial plaques to the former Jewish community have been unveiled in Eschwege. The cemetery was desecrated in 1980.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn Sources: AL, DJGH, EJL, FJG, PK-HNF, SIA, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=431,431
Erwitte,1660 (two Jews),unknown,32 (in June),"Additional Jewish population figures for Erwitte include the following: 64 in 1817 and 108 in 1864. The synagogue on 50 Helleg (formerly Kletterstrasse) was inaugurated in, at the latest, 1801. Nineteenth-century Erwitte Jews also maintained an old cemetery on Gografenstrasse (approximately 160 feet from the local castle). In 1958, after this cemetery was converted into a lawn, graves were transferred to the newer Jewish cemetery, which had been consecrated inside the general burial grounds at 1 Bundesstrasse in 1881; used until the beginning of the 20th century, the Bundesstrasse cemetery has 77 gravestones. In 1875, a local Jew was killed during anti-Jewish rioting. By June, 1933, only 32 Jews lived in Erwitte. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 9-10, 1938), the nearly defunct synagogue was ravaged, nine or 10 of its Torah scrolls ripped into shreds. The remaining Jewish homes and Jewish-owned businesses were damaged severely that night. In all, five Erwitte Jews emigrated; two of them went to the Netherlands. Seven resettled elsewhere in Germany, four died in Erwitte and 16 were deported to the East in July 1942, where they all perished. At least 20 Jewish residents of Erwitte died in the Shoah. The synagogue site—the building was torn down in 1982—accommodates a garden.

Eschweiler,1750,166 in 1885,107,"Prior to the establishment of a Jewish community, local Jews conducted services in Max Stiel’s home on Langwahn, where a Jewish elementary school was later located. According to records, prayer rooms were later set up on Wollenweberstrasse and on the corner of Neustrasse/Josefstrasse. The community established a cemetery and the elementary school in 1820 and 1858, respectively. Services were conducted in Weisweiler until September 18, 1891, when Rabbi Dr. Frank inaugurated a synagogue on Neustrasse (present-day 17 Moltkestrasse). After the inauguration of the synagogue, the prayer room at 43 Langwahn was taken over by the school, the latter of which was declared a public institution in 1905. Affiliated with Juelich after the establishment of the synagogue, the Eschweiler community attempted to gain independent status between 1912 and 1926. Ninety-two Jews lived in Eschweiler in 1936. On the night of November 9, 1938, SA men burned down the synagogue building and desecrated the rabbinical vestments. Jewish homes and stores were wrecked, and Jewish men were sent to the Oranienberg concentration camp. Forty Jews left Eschweiler after Pogrom Night. Between 1933 and 1941, approximately 70 Jews left Eschweiler, of whom half moved to other German towns, 13 immigrated to Palestine and 20 immigrated to other countries. In 1942, the remaining 20 Jews were deported in three groups: 15 on March 22, two on June 15, and three on July 3. At least 126 Eschweiler Jews perished in the Shoah.

Esens,late 17th century,124 in 1824,82,"By 1824, most local Jews were textile merchants, cattle traders, storekeepers and manufacturers. According to records, the community consecrated a cemetery on Muehlenweg in 1702, prior to which burials were conducted in Wittmund. Later, in 1828, the Jews of Esens replaced their 17th-century prayer room with a synagogue on Burgstrasse, next to the mikveh and school (both were built in 1819). A community center and a new school were established in 1899, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who served as shochet and chazzan. We also know that the community maintained organizations for Jewish men and women, and that Jews were elected to the town council after World War I. In 1933, 82 Jews still lived in Esens, of whom more than 40 left during the following years. On Pogrom Night, members of the SA and SS burned down the synagogue; Jews were taken from their homes; the men deported to Sachsenhausen. After Pogrom Night, the remaining 20-25 Jews were forced to move into the school building. In March 1940, Esens’ last Jews moved to Berlin, from where they were deported to Auschwitz in 1942. The cemetery—it had been heavily damaged during the Nazi period—was partly restored in 1980. The former community center was converted into a memorial between 1987 and 1990, and a plaque was unveiled at the synagogue site.

Essen,13th century,"5,045 in 1932/33",,"The earliest available records of a Jewish presence in Essen are dated 1291. Although Jews were expelled from Essen several times during the 14th and 15th centuries, they always managed to return. The medieval community conducted services in a prayer hall. The Jews of Essen were granted equal rights in the early 19th century, when the city was under French rule. According to records, local Jews participated in the revolution of 1848. As a result of the city’s tolerant atmosphere, the community grew rapidly: from 373 members in 1836 to 1,480 in 1895. It was in the late 19th century, too, that large numbers of Jews from Eastern Europe moved to Essen. Established in the late 17th century, the community’s first synagogue was located on Bergstrasse (present-day Im Zwoelfling). In 1808, a new synagogue was inaugurated on Weberstrasse (present-day Gerswidastrasse). A Moorish-style synagogue was built on the same site in 1870, and it was there that Jews prayed until 1913, when the community inaugurated yet another house of worship, the so-called “Old Synagogue,” at 29 Steeler Strasse. The Old Synagogue, a magnificent edifice with four cupolas, accommodated 1,400 worshipers, an organ, a women’s gallery, a mikveh and a weekday synagogue. Essen’s Jewish school, founded in 1830, was presided over by teacher Moses Blumenfeld between 1841 and 1894. The city was also home to three Jewish cemeteries: on Hoffnungsstrasse, or present-day Lazarettstrasse, between 1873 and 1923; on Reckhammerweg (1885-1991); and on Schultzstrasse/Parkfriedhof (1931 until today). Salomon Samuel served as rabbi from 1894 until 1932. In 1933, 420 children attended the Jewish elementary school. Active in the community were a Talmud Torah, a Hebrew school, a literary club and nine welfare organizations. The defunct synagogue building on Weberstrasse was torn down in 1937. After the Nazis’ election victories, anti-Semitism intensified in Essen. Local Jews were often arrested, and Jewish-owned shops were, beginning in April of 1933, boycotted. In October 1938, between 450 and 570 Polish Jews were expelled from Essen. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the Old Synagogue on fire, gutting the interior; a youth center and an Eastern European prayer hall were also burned down. Jewish homes and stores were vandalized, and approximately 700 men were sent to Dachau; most were released in February 1939. Between 1933 and 1941, the community lost 60% of its members, all of whom left Germany. Deportations commenced in late 1941, and in May 1942, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved to the Holbeckshof camp in Essen- Steele. At least 2,500 Essen Jews perished in the Shoah. Approximately 100 survivors returned to Essen after the war. A new synagogue was inaugurated on Sedanstrasse in 1959; and in November 1980, the Old Synagogue, to which a plaque has been affixed, was converted into an archive and memorial center.

No tombstones remain from Steele’s first Jewish cemetery, Am Knottenberg, which was in use from the 17th until the 19th century. The new cemetery on Hiltrups Kamp, consecrated in 1855, was used until 1943. On Pogrom Night, local SA and SS men set fire to the synagogue and the school; both were later demolished. Between 1941 and 1943, Steele’s Jews were sent to the Holbeckshof concentration camp, from where they were eventually deported to the East. Approximately 50 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

They also built a mikveh, but townspeople destroyed it in 1778. The first reference to a synagogue is dated 1816, and we also know that a new house of worship was inaugurated on Alleestrasse in 1881. By the mid-1920s, as a result of Jewish emigration, the synagogue was no longer in use. In 1933, a teacher from Schmieheim instructed two children in religion. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior was destroyed and its contents burned; Jewish homes and businesses were heavily damaged during the pogrom. The synagogue was later sold to a tannery. Five surviving Torah scrolls were transferred to Freiburg in 1947. Although many Jews fled Ettenheim, seven actually moved there after 1933. In all, 25 local Jews emigrated, 12 relocated within Germany and three died in Ettenheim. On October 22, 1940, the town’s last Jewish family was deported to Gurs.

Euskirchen-Flamersheim,17th century,95 in 1911,unknown (62 in 1932),"Beginning in the 17th century, members of Flamersheim’s Jewish community conducted religious services with the Jews of neighboring Kirchheim and Schwanheim. Although records do not tell us when it was built, we do know that a prayer room at 118 Puetzgasse served the community until the 1850s. Finally, in 1876, a synagogue with room for 60 worshipers was inaugurated in Flamersheim. The Jewish cemetery, located near the road between Flamersheim and Kirchheim, was consecrated at some point before 1790 and enlarged in the 1850s. No more than 30 tombstones are still intact, for the cemetery was largely destroyed during the Nazi period. On Pogrom Night, SA and SS men destroyed the interior of synagogue and stole ritual objects, soon after which, in 1939, the building was demolished. Saved from the destruction, the Torah scrolls are now on display in Ra’anana, Israel. Deportations to the East included 22 local Jews, of whom at least 12 are known to have perished in the Shoah. Joseph Weiss, a “camp elder” at Bergen-Belsen, was born in Flamersheim. Flamersheim became a district of the city of Euskirchen in 1969.

Euskirchen,14th century,260 in 1932,231,"The Jews of Euskirchen—a small community had been established there by 1302—were annihilated during the Black Death pogroms of 1349. Jewish families lived there sporadically during the following decades, and records from the early 15th century mention a Judengasse (“Jews’ Alley”). Established in the 17th century, the modern, largely Orthodox community initially conducted services in prayer rooms. It was during the late 19th century, however, that Euskirchen’s Jewish population experienced considerable growth: from 148 in 1871 to 260 in 1932. Many members of the 19th-century community were employed in the textile industry. In 1856, the community built a synagogue behind the Jewish school at 16 Annaturmstrasse. That house of worship was destroyed during a neighborhood fire in 1886, after which, in 1887, local Jews, in the presence of Rabbi Abraham Frank, inaugurated a new, grand synagogue with a seating capacity of 200. Euskirchen was home to three Jewish cemeteries: on Judenwall (1680-1835), on Koelner Strasse (1834-1918) and on Frauenberger Strasse (1913-1942). In 1933, 231 Jews lived in Euskirchen; approximately 20 schoolchildren received religious instruction. A mikveh was still functioning that year, and we also know that a youth organization and a social committee, the latter of which was founded in 1927 to aid the poor, were active in the community. Local Zionists organized lectures on Jewish and Zionist history. Anti-Semitic measures in Euskirchen included the boycott of April 1933; the publication of anti-Semitic articles in January 1934; and a ban, implemented by the city council in 1935, on Jews moving to Euskirchen. Most Jewish-owned businesses were forcibly closed in 1934 and in 1935. On Pogrom Night, local Nazis vandalized the synagogue, after which non-local workers set the building on fire; two Jewish cemeteries were desecrated that night. The synagogue ruins were torn down in 1940. One hundred and seventy-eight local Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany.

Falkenberg,18th century,85 in 1861 (18.6% of the total population),27,"The Jewish community of Falkenberg, which came into being in the 18th century, consisted of four families in 1744. Jews from neighboring Hebel and Homberg were affiliated with the community in Falkenberg until 1909. Services were conducted in a private residence until approximately 1730, when the community inaugurated a synagogue at 34 Dorfstrasse (present-day Melsunger Strasse); the synagogue accommodated a mikveh, a teacher’s apartment, and 26 seats for men and 16 for women. The community maintained a cemetery to the northeast of the town (1754-1938) and a Jewish school, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet, but was closed in 1908/1909. In 1933, two children studied religion with a teacher from Borken. Synagogue services were discontinued in May 1938. Six months later, on Pogrom Night, members of the SA destroyed the synagogue. In 1939, 11 Jews lived in Falkenberg, some of whom immigrated to other countries (Argentina, China and other destinations) while others relocated within Germany. At least 24 Falkenberg Jews and 12 from Hebel perished in the Shoah.

Eydtkuhnen,early 1800s,350 in 1880,under 90,"Eydtkuhnen (present-day Chernyshevkoye, Russia) was an important border crossing between Russia and Germany. From 1880 until after World War I, the town was a transit station for Jews fleeing Russia. In 1880, many of these Jews settled in Eydtkuhnen, which helps explain why this formerly tiny Jewish community peaked at 350 that year. The new arrivals conducted services in the Eydtkuhnen synagogue, built in 1870, and received financial support from the Association of East Prussian Communities. The Jewish population of Eydtkuhnen began to dwindle in the late 19th century, so that by 1925 only 120 Jews lived in the town. Of these, many left after the Nazis’ election victories. Although we do not know how many Jews lived in Eydtkuhnen in 1938, we know for certain that the synagogue was set on fire and demolished on Pogrom Night (November 1938).","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=441,441
Fechenbach,1732,70 in 1837,11,"In 1832 (perhaps earlier), the modern Jewish community of Fechenbach built a synagogue at 12 Kleine Gasse. The Jews of Fechenbach maintained a Jewish school and a mikveh, but buried their dead in Reistenhausen. Fechenbach belonged to the Aschaffenburg district rabbinate. By the end of the 19th century, as a result of declining population numbers, the school was no longer functioning. Accordingly, teachers from nearby Jewish communities instructed the village’s remaining Jewish schoolchildren. During the 1920s, when the Fechenbach community could no longer gather a minyan, the remaining Jews attended services in Miltenberg. In 1933, 11 Jews lived in Fechenbach. By January 1938, nine of them had either emigrated or moved to other German cities. The Fechenbach community was dissolved in July 1937, after which the village’s two remaining Jews were affiliated with the Miltenberg community. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the Fechenbach synagogue and all its ritual objects were destroyed. The building itself, the mikveh, and the school were lightly damaged. Fechenbach’s last two Jews left in 1939. At least 18 Fechenbach Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building became private property in 1945.

Falkenburg,1720,140 in 1889,12,"In 1720, the city council permitted one Jewish family to settle in Falkenburg on condition that they would financially support local manufacturers in obtaining raw materials such as wool and leather. It was not until the end of that century that another Jewish family settled there. Falkenburg’s Jewish population grew during the 19th century until Jews there were eventually able to form a congregation. The community maintained a synagogue (consecrated in 1841), a chevra kadisha and a sisterhood. A community functionary served as teacher, cantor and shochet until 1913, at which point an official from Dramburg took over these duties. In 1881, as anti-Semitic riots swept Pomerania, Jews and Jewish-owned properties were attacked in Falkenburg. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down completely. Those Jews who did not manage to escape during the following years were, presumably, deported to the East. Approximately 60 Jews born in Falkenburg perished in the death camps.

In 1885, when 179 Jews lived in the town (20% of the total population), most Felsberg Jews were cattle traders, butchers, shoemakers and merchants. In or around 1820, a mikveh was built on Untergasse (pulled down after World War I). Services were conducted in a prayer room until 1847, when the community established a synagogue, with 100 seats for men and 80 for women, on Rittergasse. Felsberg was home to a Jewish school (located in a historical building on Obergasse) between 1826 and 1931; as was the case in many other German communities, the teacher served as shochet and chazzan. We also know that the community consecrated a cemetery on Annastrasse in the 1860s, before which burials had been conducted in Obervorschuetz. The Rittergasse synagogue was renovated in 1903. Local Jews also maintained a charitable organization, a women’s association and a youth movement. In 1933, 105 Jews still lived in Felsberg, many of whom left—most managed to emigrate from Germany—in the wake of increasing oppression. In Felsberg, Pogrom Night started on November 8, 1938. One Jew, already ill, died as a result of the abuse suffered that night. Although the synagogue was desecrated, the building remained intact; it was converted into a sports hall after the war and, later, became an inn.

The school closed down in 1910, and Fellheim’s Jews were affiliated with the nearby community of Memmingen in 1925. On Pogrom Night, residents from the nearby village of Boos partly destroyed the inside of Fellheim’s synagogue. Later that night, SS men from Memmingen, aided by several Fellheim residents, destroyed what was left of the synagogue’s interior. The synagogue was not burned down, for most of Fellheim’s residents opposed such an act. Jewish homes were, however, damaged and plundered, and one house was destroyed; several Jews were arrested. Jews began leaving Fellheim in 1938; 12 immigrated to the United States. In 1942, 14 Jews, the last, were deported to Piaski and to Theresienstadt. At least 30 Fellheim Jews perished in the Shoah.

An official Jewish community formed there in the mid-18th century, around which time Festenberg became a popular destination for Jews who had been driven out of Breslau. Festenberg’s earl, believing that Jews would develop the economy of his region, encouraged Jewish settlement. Most Jews were merchants, and several were traveling musicians. The Jewish cemetery, which was used by several other communities, was consecrated soon after the community was founded. Local Jews also established a synagogue, located in a rented home, and, in 1845, a school; the latter, however, was closed at the end of the century for lack of students. The Jewish population of Festenberg dropped steadily during the early 20th century. During the pogrom of the night between November 9 and 10, 1938, the synagogue and three remaining Jewish-owned stores were destroyed.

A new synagogue was built in 1832/1833, and although local Jews were able to maintain their own mikveh, they conducted burials in Schopfloch. In 1933, two chevra kadisha associations (one for men, the other for women) and a charitable society were still active in Feuchtwangen. Two children received religious instruction that year. In October 1936, the community’s leader was arrested on trumped-up charges; his wife was taken into “protective” custody, and both were expelled from the town after their release. On December 20, 1937, Nazi authorities sent a mob of 400 people into Feuchtwangen’s streets demanding the expulsion of all Jews. The police arrested several Jews for their own “protection,” and one Jewish home was destroyed, its owner assaulted. By 1938, no Jews lived in Feuchtwangen. Nevertheless, the synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. Six local Jews managed to emigrate, but most were forced to relocate to other towns in Germany. At least 30 Feuchtwangen Jews perished in the Shoah.

The Jews of Fischach also maintained a mikveh. Although Jews held important positions in Fischach’s fire brigade, the Jewish community established its own brigade following disagreements with local anti-Semites. In 1933, ten children attended the Jewish school. The community ran several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide Jewish organizations. In 1936, a Beit Chalutz (Pioneer House) movement was established in Fischach to prepare young Jews for life in Palestine. Jewish houses were plundered on Pogrom Night, and one man was severely beaten; thirty Jews, including the members of Beit Chalutz, were deported to Dachau. Several days later, on November 15, 1938, SS men from Augsburg destroyed the synagogue’s interior and confiscated its contents. Thirty-five Fischach Jews emigrated, five relocated within Germany, 22 died in Fischach, 56 were deported to Piaski (April 1942) and nine, the last, were deported to Theresienstadt (August 1942).

The community belonged to the rabbinate in Diez and, later, to the rabbinate in Bad Ems (later, Ems- Weilburg). Burials were conducted in Diez until 1921, when the Jews of Flacht consecrated their own small cemetery southwest of the Christian cemetery. In 1932, seven Jewish children from Flacht studied religion in Diez. Elias Hahn was the community leader that year. Between 1933 and 1939, 26 Jews left Flacht. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was ravaged, as was other Jewish property. Jewish men were deported to concentration camps that night; Julius Saalberg, a local Jew, was shot in Buchenwald at the beginning of 1939.

The Jews of Feudenheim consecrated a cemetery at Scheffelstrasse in 1858; and in 1900 a new cemetery was consecrated at Talstrasse. Community membership dwindled to such an extent at the beginning of the 20th century that it soon became difficult to gather 10 men for a minyan. Accordingly, services were held only on High Holidays. The Feudenheim community, which had been subordinated to the Mannheim community in 1884, became an affiliate of Mannheim in 1910. On Pogrom Night, SA men tore off the synagogue’s roof tiles and set the building on fire, after which they dragged Jewish men from their homes and forced them to throw prayer books into the fire. The son of a mixed Jewish and Christian couple was beaten and arrested. On October 22, 1940, 14 Jews, Feudenheim’s last, were deported to Gurs, France.

Frankenstein,approximately 13th century,129 in 1880,47,"Records suggest that Jews first settled in Frankenstein (present-day Zabkowice Slaskie, Poland) during the 13th century. A Judengasse (“Jews’ Alley”) is mentioned in records from 1403, as are a few Jewish residents, most of whom were moneylenders. Jews were expelled from the town (or prohibited from living in it) after 1514, and it was not until the 18th century that a new Jewish presence was established there. (Moritz Sachs, the first Jew to receive an official residency permit, settled in Frankenstein in 1806.) The community maintained two cemeteries (dating back to 1815 and 1878, respectively) and a kosher slaughterhouse. In 1815, local Jews established a synagogue in a rented house; after the house burned down in 1858, the community purchased a building at 9 Niederstrasse (present-day 13 Dolnoslaska). By 1933, only 47 Jews lived in Frankenstein; by 1937, that number had plummeted to 20. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters vandalized the synagogue, a brush factory and an office. The synagogue was not burned down out of concern for the neighboring buildings. Eleven Jews lived in Frankenstein in 1939; by 1942, only one Jew resided there. The 10 Jews who lived in the town in 1939 were, presumably, deported to the East. As of this writing, memorial plaques have not been erected at the synagogue and cemetery sites.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, FJG, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=461,461
Frankenberg,"13th century, peak Jewish population",,120,"The modern Jewish community of Frankenberg traced its roots to the late 17th century. A Jewish elementary school was established in a building on Am Scharwinkel in 1831, after which, in 1838, an Orthodox synagogue (100 seats) was inaugurated there. According to records, local Jews consecrated a cemetery in the 1860s. We also know that a new school—it housed an apartment for the teacher—was established in Frankenberg in 1913; Ferdinand Stern served as teacher from 1914 until 1939, when the school closed down. Members of this community, which was affiliated with the congregation in Marburg, were mainly livestock traders and merchants. Jewish men and women’s associations were active in Frankenberg. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue and school were vandalized, all ritual objects were destroyed and Stern (the community’s last teacher) was arrested. Nearly half the Jewish population immigrated to the United States after 1933; others moved to Frankfurt am Main. In 1942, the remaining ten Jews were deported. At least eight Frankenberg Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was thoroughly renovated in the 1950s. Now a private residence, a memorial plaque was unveiled there in the late 1980s.","Swetlana Frank  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, FJG, LJG, SIA, SIH",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=460,460
Frankenthal,early 17th century,371 in 1900,266,"Jews lived in Frankenthal intermittently from the early 17th century onwards. Beginning in that century, religious services were conducted in prayer halls. A synagogue was established in Frankenthal in 1791; later, in 1885, a new synagogue was built on the same plot. In the mid-19th century, the congregation was introduced to the practice of using an organ and a choir during synagogue services. The Jews of Frankenthal consecrated a cemetery inside the municipal burial grounds in 1827; later, in 1916/17, a new cemetery was opened in the same area. A regional rabbinate was established in Frankenthal in 1828, but the rabbis themselves resided in Duerkheim. We also know that the town was home to a mikveh and a Jewish school, the latter of which was first mentioned in 1841 and presided over by Isaac Singer from 1849 until 1896. In 1933, 18 children received religious instruction. Several Jewish associations were active in the community, of which the Jews of Hessheim, Schauernheim and Oppau were members. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior, smashed its windows and confiscated ritual objects. The building was set on fire but the fire brigade, disobeying orders, extinguished the blaze. Sixteen Jewish-owned homes and businesses were wrecked, and 23 Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Under Nazi rule, 72 Frankenthal Jews emigrated and 137 relocated within Germany. The town’s last 39 Jews, including 10 patients at the local Jewish sanatorium, were deported to Gurs in October 1940. At least 102 Frankenthal Jews perished in the Shoah. Bombed during a wartime air raid, the synagogue was subsequently demolished. A nearby street was renamed Synagogengasse (“Synagogue Alley”) in 1960, in honor of the former synagogue. A memorial stone was unveiled in 1977, followed by a monument in 1988.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: AJ, EJL, FJG, SG-RPS www.juden-in-frankenthal.de/geschichte/frame_geschichte.html",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=462,462
Frankenwinheim,18th century,100 in 1837 (18.3% of the total population),54,"Frankenwinheim’s synagogue, established before 1854, was renovated in 1910, when a mikveh was added to the structure. Although the community was able to maintain its own school in the mid-19th century, burials were conducted in Gerolzhofen. Josef Kissinger, uncle of Henry Kissinger, was the community’s teacher, chazzan and shochet from 1876 until 1927. Four children studied religion in Frankenwinheim in 1933. In October 1938, riots erupted after local Jews were accused of poisoning a well. The synagogue was damaged on Pogrom Night, as were Jewish homes and businesses; many Jewish men were assaulted. The following morning, Jewish women were forced to burn the synagogue’s ritual objects in the street while dressed in prayer shawls and burial shrouds, and with the entire community looking on. Jews were then imprisoned in Gerolzhofen; they were released the next day, but five men were subsequently deported to Buchenwald. The synagogue, Jewish community house and Jewish properties were eventually confiscated. Twenty-two Frankenwinheim Jews emigrated before 1941, and another 20 relocated within Germany. The last 16 (and a family of three from Luelsfeld) were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) and to Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 36 Frankenwinheim Jews perished in the Shoah.

Frankershausen,early 17th century,96 in 1861 (10% of the total population),33,"By 1861, most Frankershausen Jews were traders, merchants, tailors, weavers and shoemakers; some were also involved in agriculture. Burials were conducted in a cemetery in Abterode, which had been consecrated in the 17th century. Between 1846 and 1922, Frankershausen’s Jewish school—it was presided over by a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet—served as a religious and elementary school; after it closed down in 1922, Jewish children attended the public school, studying religion at home or with private teachers. We also know that the community maintained a mikveh, and that services were conducted in a private residence until 1855, when a synagogue was inaugurated on Lehmkaute (36 seats for men, 21 for women). Records mention several Jewish associations, among them a charitable organization. In 1933, 33 Jews still lived in Frankershausen. Subsequent disenfranchisement caused many of them to emigrate from or relocate within Germany. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior was destroyed and two Jewish homes were attacked and vandalized, the windows broken and the interiors demolished. An elderly Jewish man was assaulted. The former synagogue was pulled down in 1940, after which a residential building was erected on the site. As of this writing, a memorial has never been erected in Frankershausen. At least 42 Frankershausen Jews perished the Shoah.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=464,464
Frankfurt am Main - Introduction,11th-12th centuries,"29,658 in 1925","26,158","The Middle Ages: Beginnings (11th to 15th centuries)  What was later to become one of the largest and most notable European Jewish communities and centers of learning began, in the 11th-12th centuries, with a trickle of Jews from Worms, most of whom did not settle in the city. Once the community became established, however, during the 13th century, it grew to approximately 200 members. Members of this early community were mainly moneylenders, silk and textile traders and importers of precious stones and metals. As elsewhere in Europe, the fortunes of the Frankfurt Jewish community waxed and waned; periods of persecution were interspersed with interventions by city authorities who recognized the Jews’ role in strengthening the local economy. In 1241, more than three-quarters of the city’s 200 Jews were massacred over the issue of forcible conversions to Christianity. Yet in 1265, just two decades later, an agreement was signed, making the townspeople responsible for Jewish lives and property. This prompted a revival of the Jewish community, as Jewish moneylenders proved a valuable source of tax revenue for the local authorities. Jewish communal institutions included hospitals, a social center, a synagogue and two Jewish educational institutions. With the outbreak of the Black Plague in the mid-14th century, Frankfurt’s Jews were massacred once again by an angry mob (1349). But in 1360, under Emperor Charles IV, Jews were encouraged to resettle in Frankfurt, receiving imperial as well as municipal protection. From 1424 until 1616, a set of regulations (known as a Schutzbrief, or “letter of protection”) governing the right of Jews to reside in Frankfurt (for which they had to pay levies) were enforced. Although the periodic imposition of new taxes weighed heavily on the city’s Jews, causing many to leave, others came to Frankfurt to escape persecution elsewhere in Germany.  The Judengasse (15th to 18th centuries) The year 1462 saw the establishment of a Jewish quarter, called the Judengasse (or “Jews’ Alley”), which would exist for 350 years. Surrounded by a wall with three gates, it consisted of a single narrow street flanked by two rows of tightly packed houses. As it could not be expanded, this ghetto became more and more crowded with the passage of time, and living conditions became increasingly unbearable. It was during this period, too, that local Jews were deprived of their citizenship. Nevertheless, the next two centuries witnessed a remarkable growth in the Judengasse’s population (“the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied” – Ex. 1:12). By 1610, the Jewish population had nearly reached 3,000 (from an original population of 110). The pendulum of Jewish fortunes swung once again in 1614, when Vincent Fettmilch, an anti-Semitic guild master who had gained control of the city, launched a violent attack on the ghetto and expelled 1,390 Jews. Two years later, Fettmilch was arrested and executed for this crime, and Emperor Matthias brought the Jews back into Frankfurt accompanied by a military band. The city even paid damages, and the Jews were assured “perpetual residence rights” with certain conditions attached: no marriages under age 25, and only 12 marriages per year. The Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) triggered a steep decline in population numbers: from 409 Jewish families in 1624 to 285 in 1639. This trend was reversed after the war ended, and by 1709 the population had grown to 505 families. In 1711, and again in 1721, fires ravaged numerous buildings in the Jewish quarter, but each time the homes and businesses were quickly rebuilt. The advent of Jewish emancipation in the second half of the 18th century gradually ended the ghetto existence of Frankfurt’s Jews; and the restoration of their full citizenship in 1811 enabled them to live anywhere in the city. In 1874, the Judengasse was finally demolished, 10 years after which, in 1884, it was renamed Boernestrasse (and Boerneplatz) after Carl Ludwig Boerne (1786-1837), who had dedicated his life to advocating equality for Jews.  Impact of the Emancipation (18th to 20th centuries) In 1742, Emperor Charles VII lifted several of the restrictions on the community—such as the requirement to wear a “Jewish badge”—a trend that developed further in 1806, when Frankfurt was incorporated into the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine. Thus, in 1808, 447 Jewish families acquired citizenship; and in 1811 the restrictions on the ghetto were abolished and the Jews of Frankfurt, who then numbered 3,117 (7% of the total population), received equal rights. In 1848, the emancipation movement was further cemented when the Frankfurt parliament implemented a list of “Basic Rights,” stipulating that civil rights were not conditional on religious faith. However, this move, hailed at the time by such liberal Jewish leaders as Abraham Geiger and others as a singularly positive achievement, was decried by the more traditional segment of the community—led by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888)—as a distinctly dangerous threat to the spiritual (and ultimately physical) survival of the Jewish community. This difference of opinion gave birth, in the mid-19th century, to the separatist religious community, the Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft (IRG). From 1851 until his death in 1888, Rabbi Hirsch headed the IRG and established it as a synagogue community, the Kehal Adass Jeshurun. Offering regular services, Sabbath sermons in German and a trained male choir, the synagogue community had, by 1860, a membership of 250 families who still belonged to the main community. As the leading representative of neo-Orthodoxy in the 19th century, Rabbi Hirsch devoted his life to the revival of Orthodox Judaism through a synthesis of Torah learning and secular studies (Torah im Derech Eretz), the same doctrine that was to inform the curriculum of the school that bore his name. After his death in 1888, Rabbi Hirsch was succeeded as spiritual leader of the IRG by his son-in-law, Salomon Breuer (1850-1926). Between 1858 and 1867, the Jewish population of Frankfurt grew, mainly as a result of an influx of Jews from rural Hesse: from 5,730 (9% of the total population) to 8,238 (over 10%), to 11,887 (12%) in 1875 and to 26,228 (6%) in 1910. New arrivals from Eastern Europe also contributed to this marked increase in the Jewish population. The passage, in 1876, of the Law of Secession—it was championed by Rabbi Hirsch and supported by Edward Lasker, representing Frankfurt in the local parliament- enabled Jews to leave their community on religious grounds and to establish or join another community. Hirsch and his adherents then seceded from the main community, officially establishing themselves as a secessionist community (Austrittsgemeinde). The new community’s majestic new synagogue, dedicated in 1907, had 1,600 seats and was the largest in Frankfurt. Many of the traditionalists, however, preferred to reach a compromise with the liberal majority, providing for separate Orthodox membership, facilities and rabbinical authority. The main community thus came to be known as the United Community (Einheitsgemeinde), in which Liberal and Orthodox coexisted. The era of the Emancipation had both positive and negative consequences for the Jewish community in Frankfurt. On the one hand, it released the Jews, to a large extent, from the onerous social and economic restrictions that had weighed so heavily on them up to that point. On the other hand, as already noted, it triggered a serious rift in the community, one that never fully healed. It was at this time that Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744- 1812) launched what was to become one of the leading banking dynasties in Europe; his sons later ran commercial branches of the bank in Vienna, London, Naples and Paris. In 1824, the Frankfurt Senate granted Jewish residents a form of citizenship that excluded them from public office but allowed them to practice law. The removal of Jewish restrictions was accelerated in 1835, when Frankfurt joined the German Customs Union, which boosted the city’s commercial importance. Many Jews participated in the struggle for political reform and for a constitution that would guarantee their civil liberties. The Jews’ social and spiritual life flourished during this period as never before. In 1847, the community, then numbering 4,737 members (8%), maintained seven synagogues, 12 prayer quorums and various welfare organizations. Earlier (in 1834), the Jewish reformers had won a sweeping victory in communal elections, and in 1842 Theodor Craizenach and others denounced circumcision, religious dietary laws and anything else that threatened to keep Jews and Gentiles apart. An enactment by the Senate in 1849 recognized the Jews as equal citizens; however, with the collapse of the 1848 revolution and the ascendancy of reactionary elements in Germany and Austria, this enactment was repealed. In 1853, with the Liberals returning to power in new elections, the pendulum swung back yet again as Jewish rights were partially restored. Finally, in 1864, a new law granted Jews equal rights. Jews played a prominent role in the economic and political life of the city. Leopold Sonnemann (1831-1909), owner and editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung from 1866, served as Chairman of the City Council for nearly 20 years and, from 1871, as a member of the Reichstag (National Parliament); several other Frankfurt Jews attained that honor between 1867 and 1890, an achievement unmatched by any other German city. Campaigners for women’s rights in Germany included Frankfurt Jews such as Henrietta Fuerth, a leading Social Democrat, and Bertha Pappenheim, co-founder of the League of Jewish Women. Jews also made a major contribution to the city’s cultural and scientific progress. Frankfurt’s public library was endowed by the Rothschild family, and Charles Hellgarten (1838-1908) donated hundreds of volumes. Jews were involved in the founding of Frankfurt University in 1914, supporting the study of modern languages, history, law and economics. Jacob Schiff, the Frankfurt-born American philanthropist, helped fund a chair in Semitic Philosophy; Berthold Freudenthal was the university’s first rector and dean of the law faculty; Paul Ehrlich (1854-1918), the Nobel Prize laureate in 1908, headed an institute of chemotherapy bearing his name. Many other prominent Jewish scholars taught at the university up until the Nazi era. At its peak, in 1925, the Jewish community of Frankfurt numbered 29,658 – over 5% of the city’s total population. The two main schools in Frankfurt were the Philanthropin (established in 1804), which introduced secular education (taught alongside Jewish studies) as well as other social and educational reforms; and the Samson Raphael Hirsch School, founded by the secessionist IRG, which was strongly opposed to these reforms (although its curriculum, too, included secular subjects). The community was home to four large synagogues and a number of smaller ones and prayer quorums. The four main synagogues were:1. The main community synagogue on the Boernestrasse (Liberal, dedicated in 1860) 2. The Boerneplatz Synagogue (Orthodox, dedicated in 1882) 3. The Kehal Adass Jeshurun in the Friedberger Anlage (Orthodox, dedicated in 1907) 4. The West End Synagogue on Freiherr-vom-Stein Strasse (Liberal, dedicated in 1910). This synagogue was re- dedicated in 1950 as the only major synagogue in Frankfurt to have survived Pogrom Night.  The Nazi Era (1933-1945) The economic crisis of 1929 triggered a sharp increase in anti- Semitic propaganda in Germany. In the Reichstag elections of July 1932, the local Nazi vote soared from under 5% (May 1928) to almost 39%. A few months later (in September of 1932), the Zionist Organization held its 24th convention in Frankfurt in the shadow of the Nazi menace. On March 12, 1933, six weeks after Hitler came to power, Ludwig Landmann was forced to resign as mayor of Frankfurt, after which a Nazi was appointed to the post. Leading opponents of the regime, among them many Jews, were arrested and sent to concentration camps. “Non-Aryan” officials and university professors were dismissed, and an economic boycott was launched against Jewish-owned factories, shops and kiosks, theaters and cinemas, as well as against Jewish lawyers, physicians, artists, writers and journalists. Jewish teachers and judges were fired, and by October, one-third of Frankfurt University’s teaching staff had been dismissed. An aggressive campaign by a local Nazi business association resulted in the closure of over 500 Jewish firms during 1933/34, the expulsion of Jews from the cattle trade in 1935, rampant unemployment and a massive flight from the capital. All reminders of Jewish contributions to the city were systematically eliminated: in the course of 1935 and 1936, every street or square bearing a Jewish designation was renamed. With Nazi persecution intensifying, the liberal Jews agreed to a power-sharing arrangement with the Zionists. Although cooperation with the IRG leadership was harder to achieve, a law banning ritual slaughter (shechitah) resulted in a joint effort to import kosher meat and poultry until this, too, was forbidden (1936). Another joint project involved provision of relief for the needy. By 1936/37, the number of Jews drawing welfare benefits had reached 4,765, but in 1939 this enterprise, too, came to an end. Zionism began to attract increasing interest and support. Hebrew classes were organized, training farms (hachsharah) prepared youngsters for work on a kibbutz and Aliyah arrangements were made through the local Palestine Office, which had to work overtime to accommodate the stream of applicants. Pogrom Night in Frankfurt began with Nazi storm troopers looting and setting fire to the Adass Jeshurun Synagogue on the Friedberger Anlage: forty Torah scrolls were destroyed in the blaze. The main community’s three synagogues also went up in flames, and others were vandalized later in the day; the police were ordered not to intervene. Storm troopers also broke into Jewish homes and shops, smashing windows and looting goods. Rioters invaded the communal offices and pillaged the Jewish Museum, but the mayor saw to it that historically valuable archives were rescued. There were mass arrests of Jewish men aged 16-50. Compelled to surrender money and valuables, the 2,621 Jews were paraded before a hostile mob and dispatched to the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps. Between April 1939 and March 1940, the number of Jewish emigrants (618 in 1938) rose to 8,500. In May 1939, 14,191 Jews still lived in Frankfurt. The main and secessionist communities were amalgamated, with an Orthodox rabbi and a liberal preacher, and services were held in the Samson Raphael Hirsch School. Jews at this time were forbidden to use public telephones, buy newspapers or visit places of entertainment. Starting in September 1941, all Jews over six years of age were forced to wear a yellow star with the word Jude (Jew) inscribed on it. More than 700 Jews committed suicide. Between October 1941 and January 1944, 9,415 Jews were deported: 6,332 for “resettlement” (mainly in Poland) and 3,083 to the Theresienstadt ghetto. By July 1, 1944, 428 remained in Frankfurt. When U.S. troops entered the city on March 29, 1945, a mere 100 Jews were still alive there. Another 300 came back after having survived the death camps. One of them was Rabbi Leopold Neuhaus, who was to head the post-war Jewish community in Frankfurt, officially re-established in 1948.   The Post-War Revival (1945 –) From about 400 members in 1945-46, the community grew to over 1,800 in 1949. By 2006, more than 7,000 Jews lived in Frankfurt, the largest Jewish community in Germany after Berlin. The West End Synagogue, which had been renovated and re-dedicated in 1950, continues to serve as the community’s main synagogue. Religious, cultural and Zionist institutions abound in Frankfurt. The Ignaz Bubis Community Center is named after the President of the Jewish community in Germany (he died in 1999). The City Council has preserved the local Jewish cemeteries and erected Shoah memorials: a school and a plaque honor the memory of Anne Frank, who perished in Bergen- Belsen (she was born in Frankfurt); and the ancient Jewish cemetery in Frankfurt’s Old City—with 2,300 tombstones and thousands of fragments—is the oldest in Germany after Worms. Five rows of metal slabs bearing the names of the 11,000 Frankfurt Jews who perished in the Shoah have been affixed to the wall that encompasses this cemetery. There are 12 Jewish cemeteries in the Frankfurt area: three of them belong to the community in Frankfurt; the other 9 serve neighboring Jewish communities. The Jewish Museum, opened in 1988, contains exhibits on the history of the Jewish community in Frankfurt. A research center for Jewish studies is to be established at Frankfurt University. The Bibliographia Judaica Archive (established in 1983) documents the Jewish contribution to the history of German culture from 1750 to the present day. The Fritz Bauer Institute (established in 1995) is the only institution in Germany dedicated exclusively to interdisciplinary research on the history and impact of Nazi crimes against humanity, with particular emphasis on the Shoah. The institute operates as an independent cultural body (affiliated, since 2000, with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University) and maintains regular contact with scientific research centers, memorial organizations and museums the world over.","Moshe Aumann Sources: EJL, GFG, LJG www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/frankfurt.html",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=465,465

As the leading representative of neo-Orthodoxy in the 19th century, Rabbi Hirsch devoted his life to the revival of Orthodox Judaism through a synthesis of Torah learning and secular studies (Torah im Derech Eretz), the same doctrine that was to inform the curriculum of the school that bore his name. After his death in 1888, Rabbi Hirsch was succeeded as spiritual leader of the IRG by his son-in-law, Salomon Breuer (1850-1926). Between 1858 and 1867, the Jewish population of Frankfurt grew, mainly as a result of an influx of Jews from rural Hesse: from 5,730 (9% of the total population) to 8,238 (over 10%), to 11,887 (12%) in 1875 and to 26,228 (6%) in 1910. New arrivals from Eastern Europe also contributed to this marked increase in the Jewish population. The passage, in 1876, of the Law of Secession—it was championed by Rabbi Hirsch and supported by Edward Lasker, representing Frankfurt in the local parliament- enabled Jews to leave their community on religious grounds and to establish or join another community. Hirsch and his adherents then seceded from the main community, officially establishing themselves as a secessionist community (Austrittsgemeinde). The new community’s majestic new synagogue, dedicated in 1907, had 1,600 seats and was the largest in Frankfurt. Many of the traditionalists, however, preferred to reach a compromise with the liberal majority, providing for separate Orthodox membership, facilities and rabbinical authority. The main community thus came to be known as the United Community (Einheitsgemeinde), in which Liberal and Orthodox coexisted. The era of the Emancipation had both positive and negative consequences for the Jewish community in Frankfurt. On the one hand, it released the Jews, to a large extent, from the onerous social and economic restrictions that had weighed so heavily on them up to that point. On the other hand, as already noted, it triggered a serious rift in the community, one that never fully healed. It was at this time that Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744- 1812) launched what was to become one of the leading banking dynasties in Europe; his sons later ran commercial branches of the bank in Vienna, London, Naples and Paris. In 1824, the Frankfurt Senate granted Jewish residents a form of citizenship that excluded them from public office but allowed them to practice law. The removal of Jewish restrictions was accelerated in 1835, when Frankfurt joined the German Customs Union, which boosted the city’s commercial importance. Many Jews participated in the struggle for political reform and for a constitution that would guarantee their civil liberties. The Jews’ social and spiritual life flourished during this period as never before. In 1847, the community, then numbering 4,737 members (8%), maintained seven synagogues, 12 prayer quorums and various welfare organizations. Earlier (in 1834), the Jewish reformers had won a sweeping victory in communal elections, and in 1842 Theodor Craizenach and others denounced circumcision, religious dietary laws and anything else that threatened to keep Jews and Gentiles apart. An enactment by the Senate in 1849 recognized the Jews as equal citizens; however, with the collapse of the 1848 revolution and the ascendancy of reactionary elements in Germany and Austria, this enactment was repealed. In 1853, with the Liberals returning to power in new elections, the pendulum swung back yet again as Jewish rights were partially restored. Finally, in 1864, a new law granted Jews equal rights. Jews played a prominent role in the economic and political life of the city. Leopold Sonnemann (1831-1909), owner and editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung from 1866, served as Chairman of the City Council for nearly 20 years and, from 1871, as a member of the Reichstag (National Parliament); several other Frankfurt Jews attained that honor between 1867 and 1890, an achievement unmatched by any other German city. Campaigners for women’s rights in Germany included Frankfurt Jews such as Henrietta Fuerth, a leading Social Democrat, and Bertha Pappenheim, co-founder of the League of Jewish Women. Jews also made a major contribution to the city’s cultural and scientific progress. Frankfurt’s public library was endowed by the Rothschild family, and Charles Hellgarten (1838-1908) donated hundreds of volumes. Jews were involved in the founding of Frankfurt University in 1914, supporting the study of modern languages, history, law and economics. Jacob Schiff, the Frankfurt-born American philanthropist, helped fund a chair in Semitic Philosophy; Berthold Freudenthal was the university’s first rector and dean of the law faculty; Paul Ehrlich (1854-1918), the Nobel Prize laureate in 1908, headed an institute of chemotherapy bearing his name. Many other prominent Jewish scholars taught at the university up until the Nazi era. At its peak, in 1925, the Jewish community of Frankfurt numbered 29,658 – over 5% of the city’s total population. The two main schools in Frankfurt were the Philanthropin (established in 1804), which introduced secular education (taught alongside Jewish studies) as well as other social and educational reforms; and the Samson Raphael Hirsch School, founded by the secessionist IRG, which was strongly opposed to these reforms (although its curriculum, too, included secular subjects). The community was home to four large synagogues and a number of smaller ones and prayer quorums. The four main synagogues were:1. The main community synagogue on the Boernestrasse (Liberal, dedicated in 1860) 2. The Boerneplatz Synagogue (Orthodox, dedicated in 1882) 3. The Kehal Adass Jeshurun in the Friedberger Anlage (Orthodox, dedicated in 1907) 4. The West End Synagogue on Freiherr-vom-Stein Strasse (Liberal, dedicated in 1910). This synagogue was re- dedicated in 1950 as the only major synagogue in Frankfurt to have survived Pogrom Night.  The Nazi Era (1933-1945) The economic crisis of 1929 triggered a sharp increase in anti- Semitic propaganda in Germany. In the Reichstag elections of July 1932, the local Nazi vote soared from under 5% (May 1928) to almost 39%. A few months later (in September of 1932), the Zionist Organization held its 24th convention in Frankfurt in the shadow of the Nazi menace. On March 12, 1933, six weeks after Hitler came to power, Ludwig Landmann was forced to resign as mayor of Frankfurt, after which a Nazi was appointed to the post. Leading opponents of the regime, among them many Jews, were arrested and sent to concentration camps. “Non-Aryan” officials and university professors were dismissed, and an economic boycott was launched against Jewish-owned factories, shops and kiosks, theaters and cinemas, as well as against Jewish lawyers, physicians, artists, writers and journalists. Jewish teachers and judges were fired, and by October, one-third of Frankfurt University’s teaching staff had been dismissed. An aggressive campaign by a local Nazi business association resulted in the closure of over 500 Jewish firms during 1933/34, the expulsion of Jews from the cattle trade in 1935, rampant unemployment and a massive flight from the capital. All reminders of Jewish contributions to the city were systematically eliminated: in the course of 1935 and 1936, every street or square bearing a Jewish designation was renamed. With Nazi persecution intensifying, the liberal Jews agreed to a power-sharing arrangement with the Zionists. Although cooperation with the IRG leadership was harder to achieve, a law banning ritual slaughter (shechitah) resulted in a joint effort to import kosher meat and poultry until this, too, was forbidden (1936). Another joint project involved provision of relief for the needy. By 1936/37, the number of Jews drawing welfare benefits had reached 4,765, but in 1939 this enterprise, too, came to an end. Zionism began to attract increasing interest and support. Hebrew classes were organized, training farms (hachsharah) prepared youngsters for work on a kibbutz and Aliyah arrangements were made through the local Palestine Office, which had to work overtime to accommodate the stream of applicants. Pogrom Night in Frankfurt began with Nazi storm troopers looting and setting fire to the Adass Jeshurun Synagogue on the Friedberger Anlage: forty Torah scrolls were destroyed in the blaze. The main community’s three synagogues also went up in flames, and others were vandalized later in the day; the police were ordered not to intervene. Storm troopers also broke into Jewish homes and shops, smashing windows and looting goods. Rioters invaded the communal offices and pillaged the Jewish Museum, but the mayor saw to it that historically valuable archives were rescued. There were mass arrests of Jewish men aged 16-50. Compelled to surrender money and valuables, the 2,621 Jews were paraded before a hostile mob and dispatched to the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps. Between April 1939 and March 1940, the number of Jewish emigrants (618 in 1938) rose to 8,500. In May 1939, 14,191 Jews still lived in Frankfurt. The main and secessionist communities were amalgamated, with an Orthodox rabbi and a liberal preacher, and services were held in the Samson Raphael Hirsch School. Jews at this time were forbidden to use public telephones, buy newspapers or visit places of entertainment. Starting in September 1941, all Jews over six years of age were forced to wear a yellow star with the word Jude (Jew) inscribed on it. More than 700 Jews committed suicide. Between October 1941 and January 1944, 9,415 Jews were deported: 6,332 for “resettlement” (mainly in Poland) and 3,083 to the Theresienstadt ghetto. By July 1, 1944, 428 remained in Frankfurt. When U.S. troops entered the city on March 29, 1945, a mere 100 Jews were still alive there. Another 300 came back after having survived the death camps. One of them was Rabbi Leopold Neuhaus, who was to head the post-war Jewish community in Frankfurt, officially re-established in 1948.   The Post-War Revival (1945 –) From about 400 members in 1945-46, the community grew to over 1,800 in 1949. By 2006, more than 7,000 Jews lived in Frankfurt, the largest Jewish community in Germany after Berlin. The West End Synagogue, which had been renovated and re-dedicated in 1950, continues to serve as the community’s main synagogue. Religious, cultural and Zionist institutions abound in Frankfurt. The Ignaz Bubis Community Center is named after the President of the Jewish community in Germany (he died in 1999). The City Council has preserved the local Jewish cemeteries and erected Shoah memorials: a school and a plaque honor the memory of Anne Frank, who perished in Bergen- Belsen (she was born in Frankfurt); and the ancient Jewish cemetery in Frankfurt’s Old City—with 2,300 tombstones and thousands of fragments—is the oldest in Germany after Worms. Five rows of metal slabs bearing the names of the 11,000 Frankfurt Jews who perished in the Shoah have been affixed to the wall that encompasses this cemetery. There are 12 Jewish cemeteries in the Frankfurt area: three of them belong to the community in Frankfurt; the other 9 serve neighboring Jewish communities. The Jewish Museum, opened in 1988, contains exhibits on the history of the Jewish community in Frankfurt. A research center for Jewish studies is to be established at Frankfurt University. The Bibliographia Judaica Archive (established in 1983) documents the Jewish contribution to the history of German culture from 1750 to the present day. The Fritz Bauer Institute (established in 1995) is the only institution in Germany dedicated exclusively to interdisciplinary research on the history and impact of Nazi crimes against humanity, with particular emphasis on the Shoah. The institute operates as an independent cultural body (affiliated, since 2000, with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University) and maintains regular contact with scientific research centers, memorial organizations and museums the world over.","Moshe Aumann Sources: EJL, GFG, LJG www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/frankfurt.html",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=466,466
Frankfurt an der Oder,1253,800 in 1864,,"Frankfurt an der Oder, a flourishing trading hub, was home to one of Germany’s oldest Jewish settlements. Its cemetery dates back to 1399, and is the oldest in Brandenburg. The modern community was born in 1671, when Jews from Poland and Vienna arrived in the city. The university attracted letterpress printers and those with academic aspirations: a Jewish printer published the first complete version of the Talmud in Frankfurt an der Oder; and in 1678, for the first time in history, two Jews were accepted into a German university. The synagogue, built in 1716, was located in a private house until 1822, when a new house of worship was built at 60 Tuchmacherstrasse (present-day Karl-Marx-Allee). The community established a Jewish school on Richterstrasse/ Wollenbergstrasse in 1819 and a hospital (at 36 Rosenstrasse) in 1838. As Jews poured in from Western Russia, and later from territories surrendered to Poland, the Frankfurt an der Oder community grew steadily. A smaller, Orthodox community opened its own prayer hall on Spornmacherstrasse. Frankfurt an der Oder was home to several renowned rabbis: Meir Tiomim, who in 1763 wrote an important commentary to the Shulchan Aruch; Samuel Holdheim, who served as rabbi of Frankfurt an der Oder (1836-1840) before founding the Reform congregation in Berlin; and Ignatz Maybaum, a leading figure in German Liberal Judaism. In 1934, in response to dwindling membership numbers, the two congregations merged. The elections of 1933 triggered the first wave of emigration. Zionist groups like Werkleute and Beth Halutz prepared many Frankfurt an der Oder Jews for immigration to Palestine by training them in Hebrew, agriculture and craftsmanship. On Pogrom Night, SA men looted and destroyed Jewish properties. They also set fire to the synagogue, and the ensuing blaze consumed the interior, the organ and many other valuable ritual objects. Many men were arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. We also know that the school was eventually closed, the building sold to a carpet dealer. At least 110 Frankfurt an der Oder Jews were murdered during the Shoah. A new congregation was established there after the war. At the synagogue site—it now accommodates a shopping mall—a memorial stone was unveiled in 1988, in the presence of Kurt Cassel—a Shoah survivor and Frankfurt’s last acting rabbi. The plaque was later moved to another location. The Jewish cemetery, now on Polish territory, was leveled in 1970.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, FJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=472,472
Fraustadt,late 1500s,648 in 1810,125,"The first Jews of Fraustadt (present-day Wschowa, Poland) engaged in moneylending, a business from which Christians were banned by the Church. Throughout approximately the next 150 years, Jews were expelled from the town any time they tried to settle there. It was not until 1720, soon after the authorities reversed their policy on Jewish settlement, that a lasting Jewish community was established in Fraustadt. This community consecrated a cemetery in 1759. Built in 1798 on land owned by a community member, the town’s first synagogue burned down in 1801, during a fire that consumed most of Fraustadt. The community undertook its reconstruction in 1806, and it was completed three years later. When new fire and safety codes were instituted in 1880, however, the synagogue failed the inspection tests and was declared a hazard. Rather than undertaking the costly renovations, the community decided to tear down the synagogue and build a new one in its place. The cornerstone was laid in April 1885, and the synagogue was inaugurated in September of that year. An elementary school, founded in 1820, served the Jewish children of Fraustadt. In response to the difficult economic situation of the late 1800s, local Jews began to emigrate from Germany, a process that accelerated when the Nazis rose to power. On Pogrom Night, local SA troops set fire to the synagogue; crowds of locals watched as the building burned to the ground. The ruins were carted away shortly afterwards. As of this writing, there is no trace of there ever having been a synagogue in Fraustadt.","Moshe Finkel Sources: EJL, LJG, IAJGS  www.sztetl.org.pl",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=473,473
Frechen,14th century,unknown,45,"It was not until the 18th century that continuous Jewish settlement was established in Frechen. In 1803, the community inaugurated a synagogue in a half-timbered building at 84 Hauptstrasse; the building, which was renovated in 1873, seated approximately 100 worshipers. In 1842, the synagogue community—which incorporated the Jews of Frechen, Grefrath and Grosskoenigsdorf—numbered 177 members. Forty-five Jews lived in Frechen in June 1933, of whom three left for Belgium that year. The community’s shochet immigrated to South Africa in 1936; others immigrated to the United States, some before the outbreak of the war, via England and Shanghai. In 1940 the Gestapo in Belgium arrested some Jews who had come there from Frechen. On Pogrom Night, SA men and members of the Hitler Youth vandalized the cemetery and ravaged the synagogue, after which they tore the iron Star of David from the roof and used it to smash windows in Jewish homes and businesses. At the butcher’s shop, which was also destroyed, the rioters poured poison on the kosher meat. One Torah scroll from the synagogue was saved and later taken to New York. In 1938 or 1939, the synagogue was sold to private buyers and used as a shop whose storage area was located on the women’s balcony. On September 25, 1939, nine impoverished Frechen Jews were forcibly moved into the Levy family’s residence. Of these, a Jewish man and his son (both forced laborers) later moved to Cologne, as did an unmarried Jewish woman. Another unmarried Jewish woman moved to the Rheidt old- age home in 1941, after which only three Jewish women and their children from mixed marriages remained in Frechen. Twelve Frechen Jews were murdered in the Lodz Ghetto; in Riga, all but three of the 18 Frechen Jews who were sent there perished; and in Minsk, where nine local Jews were sent, all perished. Five were murdered in Auschwitz, one in Izbica and one at an unknown location. At least 43 Frechen Jews perished in the Shoah. At the synagogue site—the building was torn down in the 1960s—two plaques commemorate Pogrom Night. In 1988, a plaque was unveiled in the town’s pedestrian zone; and in November 1988, a street neighboring the former synagogue’s site was renamed An der Synagoge.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: LVAJ, SG-NRW  www.frechener-geschichtsverein.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=474,474
Freiburg,1230,"1,399 in 1925","1,138","The Jews of Freiburg, first mentioned in 1230, were annihilated during the Black Death pogroms of 1349. Jews were allowed to return to the town in 1373, but were expelled in 1401 and 1424. Individual Jews lived in Freiburg throughout the ensuing centuries, but it was only in 1862 that they were permitted to settle freely. A community was founded in 1863, and peaked in 1925 with 1,399 members. The Jewish community established a prayer hall in 1864; a synagogue at Werderstrasse in 1870 (enlarged and renovated in 1926); a cemetery in 1870 (desecrated in 1910); an orphanage in 1874; and, finally, a mikveh. Orthodox Jews founded their own congregation in 1895, one year after which they inaugurated a prayer hall inside the community center (near the aforementioned synagogue). Freiburg hosted a district rabbinate after 1885. Jewish students were first admitted to Freiburg University in the late 1800s: by 1924/25, they made up 10% of the student body and were a majority in the medical faculty. Chaim Weizmann, Israel’s first president, obtained his doctorate in chemistry from Freiburg in 1899. Many Jewish professors, including the philosopher Edmund Husserl and Nobel laureate Hans Adolf Krebs, taught at the university. In 1933, 1,138 Jews lived in Freiburg. Dr. Julius Zimels was district rabbi, and the community employed two teachers/cantors—they instructed 128 schoolchildren— and a shochet. Many Jewish associations and branches of national organizations were active in Freiburg. During the Nazi period, all Jewish university staff members were fired. Rabbi Zimels emigrated in 1936, after which Rabbi Siegfried Scheuermann held the post of district rabbi. On Pogrom Night, after the synagogue was set on fire, its charred ruins were blown up. One hundred Jewish men were sent to Dachau (some were tortured beforehand), where two died. Rabbi Scheuermann, forced to leave Germany, immigrated to the United States. The synagogue’s ruins were cleared at the community’s expanse. Six hundred and fifty-seven local Jews emigrated, others relocated inside Germany, 148 died in Freiburg, nine committed suicide and, on October 22, 1940, 350 were deported to Gurs. Forty-one Jews—old, sick or married to Christians—remained in Freiburg after the deportation; most were deported to Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 314 Freiburg Jews perished in the Shoah. A new community was founded in Freiburg in 1945; in 1987, a new synagogue was inaugurated there. The cemetery, which had been heavily damaged during the Nazi period, was later renovated, and memorials were unveiled at the former synagogue site (1962) and cemetery (1986).","Nurit Borut and Maren Cohen Sources: AJ, PK-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=475,475
Freren,17th century,25 in 1905,17,"Freren (Lower Saxony) – First Jewish presence: 17th century; peak Jewish  The Jewish community of Freren, officially founded in 1844, included Jews from several neighboring communities. When the tiny community recorded its peak membership figure in 1905, most local Jews earned their livings as butchers. Beginning in the 18th century, burials were conducted in Lingen, which was affiliated with the Freren community; in 1924, however, the Jews of Freren consecrated their own cemetery on the street leading to Fuerstenau. Services were conducted in a private Jewish residence on Grulandstrasse. The community was not always able to maintain a Jewish school; therefore Jewish children often attended the local educational institutions with their Christian peers. During the second half of the 19th century, a teacher/chazzan intermittently instructed Freren’s Jewish children in religion. Records from the 1930s tell us that Freren was, during that decade, home to a Jewish women’s association. The cemetery was desecrated on Pogrom Night, and the prayer room was broken into and demolished by members of the local SA; ritual objects were thrown onto the street and burned, and the wife of the owner of the building was beaten and arrested. Jewish men were carted around town in a cattle wagon. By 1939, only ten Jews remained in Freren. In 1984, a memorial plaque was affixed to house in which the community had its prayer room. At least six Jews from Freren perished in the Shoah.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, HU, JG NB1, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=476,476
Freudenburg,1589 (one Jew),69 in 1905,44,"Although a number of Jews lived in Freudenburg in 1630, they disappeared from the village during the Thirty Years’ War. A new Jewish presence was established in the late 17th century. The community laid a cemetery in, at the latest, 1694, around which time a Jewish school was opened in Freudenburg. Local Jews initially conducted services in the teacher’s residence on Hintergasse, and we also know that in 1784/85, the community built a synagogue on the same street; renovated on several occasions—records suggest that a women’s balcony with 20 seats was built in 1879—the synagogue seated 25 male worshipers. Freudenburg Jews also maintained a mikveh. In Freudenburg, Jewish teachers performed the duties of chazzan and shochet until the 1920s, after which a teacher traveled around the Jewish communities of Freudenburg, Kirf and Wawern. Two chevra kadisha associations (one for men, the other for women) were active in the community in 1933. Twelve children received religious instruction that year. In 1935, anti-Jewish riots erupted in Freudenburg. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), local Nazis and construction workers destroyed the synagogue’s interior and set the building on fire. Many Freudenburg Jews fled during the Nazi period. In September 1939, when the village was evacuated, four local Jews were brought to Trier. At least 28 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue’s remaining walls were damaged in an air raid in 1944/45 and torn down in 1962; a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the site in 1995.

Friedberg,1241,491 in 1910,305,"Although the Jewish community of Friedberg was persecuted in 1338 and annihilated during the Black Death pogroms of 1349, a new Jewish presence was established in the town soon afterward. The community, with which the Jews of Ober- Rosbach, Fauerbach and Dorheim were affiliated, peaked in 1910 with 491 members. Beginning in the 13th century, the medieval community maintained a synagogue, a mikveh and a cemetery; in 1523, at which point Friedberg was home to a wall-enclosed ghetto, a new cemetery was consecrated. Between the 1630s and 1741, the Friedberg rabbi was responsible for the Hessen duchy. The synagogue was enlarged in the years 1846, 1881 and 1931, after which it accommodated 320 worshippers. At some point during the 18th century, the community’s elementary school became a school for religious studies whose teacher also served as chazzan and shochet. In 1932, the community opened a community center with a weekday prayer hall. Forty-one children studied religion in Friedberg in 1933. Several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community that year. A new Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1934. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. Jewish homes and businesses were attacked, property and merchandise were destroyed or thrown onto the street, and 43 men were sent to Buchenwald. In 1939, the synagogue ruins were demolished. Both cemeteries were cleared. Eighty-three local Jews emigrated; most of the others relocated within Germany. The remaining Jews were later moved into “Jews’ houses,” from which 61 were deported to Poland and to Theresienstadt in 1942. Seven Jewish women, all of whom were married to ethnic Germans, were deported in late 1944 and January 1945. At least 132 Friedberg Jews perished in the Shoah. In August 1945, survivors of the Shoah founded a new community in Friedberg; most left during the years that followed, and the community was accordingly dissolved in 1948.

Frielendorf,16th century,144 in 1905 (12.5% of the total population),58,"Frielendorf’s Jewish community developed in the 18th century. One hundred and thirty-seven Jews lived in Frielendorf in 1885 (approximately 15% of the total population), most of whom were cattle and horse traders, butchers and textile merchants. In 1923, the Jewish cemetery (located near a coal mine) was moved to a location close to the road to Grossropperhausen. Local Jews maintained a mikveh, and records from 1829 mention a prayer room, the latter of which was used until 1843 (or 1835), when the community converted part of a barn on Steinweg (present-day Hauptstrasse) into a synagogue. The Jewish school—it was presided over by a teacher who also performed the duties of shochet and chazzan—was dissolved in 1933. Frielendorf was home to a Jewish women’s association, a charitable organization and a Talmud Torah association. Many community members were active in the town’s social and political life. In 1933, 58 Jews lived in Frielendorf, many of whom left during the years that followed. Synagogue services were discontinued in 1937; the ritual objects were moved to Kassel, where they were destroyed on Pogrom Night. On Pogrom Night in Frielendorf, the synagogue building was vandalized and one Jewish home was attacked. The remaining Jews left town during the next few months. At least 50 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1939, the former synagogue was sold and remodeled as a combined residential and commercial building. A plaque, unveiled in Frielendorf in 1988, commemorates the Jewish community.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL  www.frielendorf.de/start.php?page=sehenswuerdigkeiten&link=5#a1",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=482,482
Friesheim,unknown,61 in 1861,26,"In 1665, three Jewish families lived in Friesheim. The synagogue association of Lechenich-Friesheim- Gymnich was formed in 1849, but each town maintained its status as an independent Jewish community. Records tell us that 60 Jews lived in Friesheim in 1872, when the town’s total population was 1,245. In Friesheim, prayer rooms were established in the Cahn and Hirsch family homes. The 19th-century community attended Sabbath services in Weilerswist until 1863, when a synagogue was inaugurated at 35 Niederweg (formerly 41 Niederweg). We also know that a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Friesheim in the 1850s. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was destroyed, after which the building was torn down with the help of the volunteer fire brigade. Eighteen Jews still lived in Friesheim in 1939. Later, in July 1942, the town’s remaining Jews were deported to the East. At least 89 Friesheim Jews perished in the Shoah.

Friesenheim,1452,135 in 1880,33,"The Jewish community of Friesenheim dates back to the 17th century. Prayers were initially conducted in a private residence, but in the 1820s a proper synagogue was established in the town. Local Jews conducted burials at the Schmieheim cemetery, and we also know that the community maintained a mikveh. By the 1920s, because it had become difficult to find the 10 men necessary for a minyan, services were sometimes conducted together with the Diersburg community. In 1933, the 33 Jews of Friesenheim maintained a chevra kadisha and a bikur cholim (a society for visiting the sick). The synagogue building was not damaged on Pogrom Night, butitsTorahscrollsandritualobjectsweredestroyed;several Jews were sent to Dachau. Thirteen Friesenheim Jews emigrated, five relocated within Germany and three died in Friesenheim. On October 22, 1940, nine local Jews were deported to Gurs. One Jewish couple remained in the town after the deportation: the husband committed suicide in April 1942, and his wife was deported to Izbica. At least 22 Friesenheim Jews perished during the Shoah. The synagogue, bought in 1940 for a fraction of its actual cost by the municipality, was sold in 1944. The building was demolished in 1990.

Fritzlar,Middle Ages,163 in 1885 (5% of the total population),128,"Although we do not know when Jews first settled in Fritzlar, records do tell us that a Jewish community— whose members were mainly moneylenders— was annihilated during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/1349. The town’s modern Jewish community developed in the 19th century. The Jews of Fritzlar consecrated a cemetery on Schladenweg in 1733. In the early 19th century (records tell us that it was before 1827), the community replaced its 18th-century prayer room with a synagogue on Untere Nikolausstrasse; the building also accommodated a Jewish school whose teacher served as shochet and chazzan. In 1897, a new synagogue and school were erected on Holzstrasse (present-day Neustaedter Strasse). Records indicate that the synagogue was thoroughly renovated in 1930. Fritzlar was home to two Jewish associations (one for men, the other for women) and a charitable organization. At some point during the 19th century, the community temporarily split as a result of religious differences. In 1933, 128 Jews still lived in Fritzlar, many of whom left town due to increasing oppression. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), SS men and members of the Hitler Youth set the synagogue on fire, soon after which the building was pulled down. The Jewish cemetery was demolished in 1943. In 1941 and 1942, Fritzlar’s remaining Jews were deported to concentration camps. At least 70 Fritzlar Jews perished in the Shoah. After the war, Jewish displaced persons were housed in Fritzlar by the United Nations; all eventually left, mostly for Israel.

Fronhausen,1592,46 in 1846,unknown (20 in 1930),"Until the mid-19th century, the Jews of Fronhausen were members of a synagogue association formed with the Jews in nearby Lohra and Roth. In 1870, several years after they began conducting services in a rented prayer hall, the Fronhausen Jews were recognized as an independent Jewish community. Most local Jews were livestock traders and butchers at that time. In 1874, a Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Stollberg. The community maintained its own mikveh and synagogue, the latter of which was established in a community-owned house on Marburger Strasse in 1896. Fronhausen was home to a Jewish school from 1882 until 1899. In early 1930, only six Jewish families lived in Fronhausen, some of whom eventually emigrated. The cemetery was vandalized on Pogrom Night; windows in the synagogue were broken and the building’s furniture was looted. Later, in 1941, the remaining Jewish residents were deported; according to records, 20 were deported from Fronhausen to the death camps, where they perished. Two local Jewish women survived the Riga Ghetto and immigrated to the United States in 1945.

Fuerfeld,1633,161 in 1871,56,"The Jewish community of Fuerfeld, with which the Jews of Frei-Laubersheim were affiliated, built its first synagogue in 1760. In 1895, a new synagogue was inaugurated at 13 Rathausstrasse (renovated in 1928). The Jews of Fuerfeld not only maintained a mikveh and a cemetery—the latter of which was consecrated in either the 17th or 18th century (enlarged in 1903)—but also employed a teacher of religion who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet; Moses Mayer held this post from 1891 until 1926. In 1933, the community ran a chevra kadisha, a women’s association and a society for the care of the sick. Fuerfeld’s Jewish teacher was sent for a while to the Osthofen concentration camp in 1933, and we also know that he left the community in 1937. On Pogrom Night, local Jews were forced to participate in the destruction of their synagogue. An agricultural cooperative appropriated the synagogue in 1939. Twenty-three Fuerfeld Jews emigrated during the Nazi period (16 went to the United States) while others relocated within Germany—the last, a woman, left in September 1940. Five Frei-Laubersheim Jews emigrated (three went to the United States) and six moved to other places within Germany. At least 26 Jews from Fuerfeld and six from Frei- Laubersheim perished in the Shoah. The Fuerfeld cemetery was desecrated while the Nazis were in power. Although a Catholic congregation bought the former synagogue in 1952, the building was demolished in 1959.

Fuerstenau,1621,unknown,20-22,"Although records indicate that a “protected Jew” lived in Fuerstenau in 1683, it was not until the 19th century that the town’s Jewish community experienced considerable growth: from five Jewish families in the early 1800s to 56 Jews in 1846. In 1871, however, the Jewish population dropped to 31. The Jews of Fuerstenau consecrated a cemetery in, at the latest, 1773. Services were conducted in a rented house at 42, Sievers until 1854, when a synagogue was inaugurated on Schwertestrasse. The first leader of the community was Moses Bachmann, the second Siegfried Bachmann and the third Markus Judenberg. Fuerstenau, which belonged to the district rabbinate of Minden, was home to a Jewish school, a Jewish teacher and a cantor. We also know that the synagogue association of Fuerstenau, established in 1853, included the Jewish communities of Loewendorf, Boedexen and Brenkhausen. The Jewish cemetery, called auf dem Judenberg (“on the Jews’ hill”), was and still is located close to the road to Boedexen, from where one can access the cemetery through two small gates. Records tell us that the site was enlarged in 1773; the oldest extant tombstone, however, is dated 1825. The last burial was conducted in 1940. Neglected for many years, the cemetery is now properly maintained: several stones have been re-erected, and 32 others have been preserved. The graves (Jews from Albaxen and from Stahlen are also buried there) are arranged according to family name, for example, Rosenstein, Lipper and Bachmann. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue on fire, after which the damaged building was remodeled into a garage. Less than 10 months later, when World War II broke out, only 18 Jews remained in Fuerstenau; all were deported to the concentration camps, where most of them perished. At least 42 Fuerstenau Jews perished in the Shoah, of whom 27 were deported to the extermination camps directly from the town.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: EJL, GLJW, SG-NRW  steinheim-institut.de  www.jacob-pins.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=489,489

Beginning in the 18th century, burials were conducted in Lingen. Although the six Jews of Fuerstenau officially joined the Jewish community of Freren in 1844, they continued to maintain their own prayer room on Bahnhofstrasse. Fuerstenau’s Jewish school was established in 1885. Beginning in 1929, burזials were conducted in a section of the municipal cemetery. On Pogrom Night, Jewish men were arrested and detained temporarily. The prayer room was broken into and demolished—the interior furnishings were thrown onto the street, as were the ritual objects—and the building was burned to the ground, soon after which the ruins were razed. By 1939, only 18 Jews remained in the town. In 1988, the Jewish community acquired six Jewish graves in the municipal cemetery. As of this writing, no memorial commemorates the lost community or its synagogue.

Fuerstenwalde,14th century,145 in 1880,150,"The history of Jewish Fuerstenwalde dates back to 1379, when an unidentified Jew was burned at the stake there. By 1743, four Jewish families lived in the town. During the 1850s, Fuerstenwalde’s 27 Jews conducted services together with the Jews of Frankfurt an der Oder. Local Jews set up a synagogue on the premises of a defunct company and conducted services there until 1824, when a new house of worship was built at 96 Frankfurter Strasse. It was not, however, until 1886 that a Jewish community was founded officially. The old Jewish cemetery, consecrated near the Neues Tor in 1795, was used until approximately 1829; in 1850, it was taken over by a local brewery. The new cemetery on Frankfurter Strasse, on the corner with Gruenstrasse, was consecrated in 1829 and enlarged a century later. (In 1980, after a series of desecrations, most of the tombstones were removed; approximately 25 are still intact.) The first Jewish school for the hearing and speech impaired in Germany, the Israelitische Taubstummenanstalt, was founded in Fuerstenwalde in 1873. In 1933, a Zionist agricultural school was established on the Neuendorf estate; its last 80 trainees were deported to Berlin, and from there to Theresienstadt and to Auschwitz, in April 1943. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down, the cemetery desecrated and the mortuary destroyed; Jewish shops were vandalized and looted, and Jews were publicly humiliated and assaulted. Later, in 1942, the famous German-Jewish entertainer Hans Rosenthal, who survived the war in a Berlin hide-out, was forced to work in Fuerstenwalde’s municipal cemetery. At least 22 Fuerstenwalde Jews perished in the Shoah. Only six, probably protected by mixed marriages, remained in Fuerstenwalde after the deportations.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: AJ, EJL, GJF, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=490,490
Fuerth,15th century,"3,330 in 1880 (10.7% of the total population)","1,990","Fuerth’s 16th-century Jewish community was the largest in Bavaria and the most influential in the whole of Germany. It was not, however, until 1601 that communal services were conducted in Fuerth (in a private residence). The community employed its first rabbi in 1607, and we also know that, in 1617, a synagogue—it was referred to as the Altschul (the “old school”)—was inaugurated in Fuerth; the synagogue was renovated in 1831 and again in 1865. Local Jews established a cemetery and a mikveh in 1607 and 1697, respectively. Other communal institutions included the country’s first Jewish hospital (founded in 1653), a Talmud Torah (1697), a renowned yeshiva and, finally, an orphanage (1763). The city was also famous for its Jewish printing houses. In 1830, the authorities closed down the yeshiva. The hospital was moved to a new building in 1846 (enlarged in 1864). Fuerth’s Jewish school, opened in 1862, attracted so many students that the community eventually decided to establish a high school there. Records also tell us that the Jews of Fuerth consecrated a new cemetery in 1880, and that Orthodox Jews broke away from the mainstream community in 1873. In 1923, the community further enriched its cultural life by establishing a community hall whose premises included an extensive library. The mainstream community renovated its synagogue in 1925, after which, in 1927, the hospital was thoroughly modernized. In 1933, 1,990 Jews lived in Fuerth; 184 pupils attended the school. Dr. Siegfried Behrens was district rabbi, and Dr. Yehuda Breslauer presided over the Orthodox congregation. Fuerth was home to seven synagogues in 1933, six of which belonged to the Orthodox community: the Mannheimer (opened in the mid-17th century); the Klaus (1691); the Neuschul, or “new school” (1697); the Weisen-Synagoge (at the orphanage); the Spital-Synagoge (at the hospital); and the Polnische Synagoge (the Polish synagogue). The first four of these synagogues were located in a large yard, referred to as the Schulhof (schoolyard), which also accommodated a mikveh, the community’s offices and a kosher butcher’s shop. In August 1933, military units were sent to the city to protect Jews from the SA. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), almost all Jewish public buildings, including those in the Schulhof, were destroyed, as were Jewish-owned businesses. All Jews—including women, children and invalids—were forced to stand in the city square for five hours, while they were mocked and humiliated by a crowd of onlookers; Rabbi Behrens was forced to desecrate a Torah scroll. The next morning, all men under the age of 60 were arrested and tortured. One hundred and fifty men were sent to Dachau after the pogrom, around which time the community leaders were forced to sell, for a mere 200 Reichsmarks, the two cemeteries, the community center, the hospital and all other community properties. Jews continued to attend the hospital and orphanage synagogues until the deportations began. In total, 1,400 Jews left Fuerth before 1941. Of those who remained, 504 were deported to the East and to Theresienstadt between 1941 and 1944. At the end of 1942, the Jews of Nuremberg were sent to Fuerth and, from there, to the camps. At least 600 Fuerth Jews perished in the Shoah. A new Jewish community was founded in Fuerth after the war. In 1949, the old cemetery was partially renovated. Several memorials were later erected in the city, now home to a museum of Franconian Jewry (opened in 1999). Furth’s present-day Jewish community has its own rabbi and synagogue.

Fulda,early Middle Ages,"1,137 in 1925","1,038","Jews lived in Fulda in the Middle Ages, perhaps as early as the 8th century. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated there in the early 13th century, and the town was also home to a renowned yeshiva. Records from 1423 mention a synagogue, and we also know that a mikveh was built on the Judengasse (“Jews’ Alley”). In 1603, a regional rabbinical court—one of five in Germany – was established in Fulda. The community founded a Jewish school, also one of Germany’s first, in 1784; a new synagogue (335 seats) in 1859; a new cemetery in 1904; and an old-age home in 1930. The synagogue was enlarged in 1927 to include 730 seats, and the yeshiva was renovated during the Weimar period. During the 1920s, agricultural training centers in nearby Rodges and Geringshof prepared many Zionist Orthodox youth for immigration to Palestine. The cemetery was desecrated in 1923 and again in 1928. In 1933, Dr. Leo Kahn was district rabbi. Ninety-two children attended the school, and 60 others received religious instruction. Several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community that year. Windows in Jewish shops and homes were smashed on many occasions after 1933. Jews were often abused in the streets, and the cemetery was desecrated in 1935. In October 1938, 41 Polish Jews were deported from Fulda to Poland. One month later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down together with its ritual objects and Torah scrolls. The yeshiva was destroyed, the school building was damaged, the two cemeteries were desecrated, and Jewish homes and businesses were ransacked. A Jewish woman was raped that night, and Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald and to Dachau. In December 1938, the community was forced to clear the synagogue’s ruins at its own expense. Gravestones from the old cemetery, which was cleared by the Nazis and turned into a park, were used as building material. The new cemetery was closed in October 1940, after which burials took place in Weyhers. Many Jews moved to Fulda after 1933, and 70 Jewish babies were born there in the years that followed. Nine hundred and thirty-five Jews emigrated, 246 relocated within Germany and approximately 100 passed away in the town. In December 1941, 132 Jews (including 35 children) were deported, via Kassel, to Riga; in May 1942, 36 were deported to the Lublin area (Poland); and in September 1942, 76 were deported to Theresienstadt. At least 361 Fulda Jews perished in the Shoah. The new Jewish community of Fulda, founded in September 1945, conducted services in the former school building until it was sold in 1950. The building was repurchased in 1987, after which a prayer hall with 48 seats was established there.

Gailingen was home to a Jewish elementary school from 1815 until 1876, after which the Jewish community employed a teacher who also served as the chazzan and shochet. In 1827, a regional rabbinate was established in the town. Leopold Guggenheim was elected head of the local council in 1870, the first Jew in Germany to hold such a position. Dr. Mordechai Bocherer was regional rabbi in 1933. Thirty-three schoolchildren received religious instruction that year, and Jewish associations and branches of national Jewish organizations were active in the community. In October 1938, the town’s Polish Jews were deported to Poland. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects were destroyed, after which the building was set on fire.

As a result of a private initiative, a black memorial stele was unveiled at the Jewish cemetery, where 31 tombstones have been preserved. When the village of Garzweiler was relocated in the 1980s, the tombstones were moved to a new location; in 1990, the new burial grounds were dedicated.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=497,497
Gau-Odernheim,late 13th century,106 in 1880,37,"Although Jews were annihilated in Gau-Odernheim during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/48, a Jewish presence was subsequently re-established there. Records tell us that the community grew during the 17th century, and that the modern community, to which the Jews of Koengernheim were affiliated, peaked at 106 in 1880. Gau-Odernheim was home to a prayer hall in the 19th century, presumably used until the establishment, in 1868, of a synagogue on Mainzer Strasse. Although we do not know when Gau-Ordenheim’s first Jewish cemetery was consecrated, records do tell us that the community established a new one in 1848 (the old burial grounds were sold in 1919). Local Jews also maintained a mikveh and a school for religious studies, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, 37 Jews lived in Gau-Odernheim (three more Jews moved to the village after the Nazis came to power); six Jewish children received religious instruction. The cemetery was desecrated in 1935. Damaged on Pogrom Night, the synagogue building was later used as a camp for girls from local farming families. Records from 1940 indicate that the town authorities invested a lot of money in renovating the former synagogue and converting it into an apartment block. Twenty-seven Gau-Odernheim Jews managed to flee Nazi Germany; the rest relocated within the country. By the summer of 1939, no Jews remained in the village. At least 24 Gau-Odernheim Jews perished in the Shoah. All traces of the former synagogue were removed during the renovation process.

Gauersheim,unknown (see below),173 in 1835,16,"A relatively large Jewish community flourished in Gauersheim during the 18th century. In 1768, the community established its first synagogue on present-day Friedhofstrasse. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1770 and enlarged in 1874. Although plans for the construction of a new synagogue and school were made in 1824, they never materialized. Instead, the original synagogue’s chairs were replaced by benches in 1865; further improvements were made in 1877, and the end result was a women’s balcony with 23 seats and a main sanctuary with 40 seats for men. A fireplace was added in 1906. During the 19th century, the community employed a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. Gauersheim’s Jewish schoolhouse housed an apartment for the teacher. By 1933, the Jews of Albisheim had been affiliated with the Gauersheim community. Sixteen Jews lived in Gauersheim that year, but this figure increased to 38 in 1936. All religious services ceased after 1933, and the last Jewish burial took place in 1934. Although the synagogue was no longer in use, its windows were smashed in 1937. The synagogue’s roof was destroyed on Pogrom Night, the interior demolished. Gauersheim’s Jewish community was later forced to sell the synagogue’s ruins to the local authorities; the sale covered the cost, for which the Jews had been billed, of clearing the debris. The building was demolished in 1939/40. All Jews had left Gauersheim by September 1939. At least 10 Gauersheim Jews perished in the Shoah.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: AJ, FJG, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=499,499
Gaukoenigshofen,1555,108 in 1816 (20% of the total population),54,"The Jewish community of Gaukoenigshofen, founded in the 18th century, established the following institutions: a synagogue and mikveh in 1768/1769 (rebuilt in 1842 and renovated in 1929); a new mikveh in 1819; and a community center—it housed a classroom and living quarters for the teacher—in 1910. The Jews of Gaukoenigshofen buried their dead in Allerheim. Baron Jacob Hirsch, founder of the Hirsch family fortune and grandfather of the philanthropist Maurice Hirsch, was born in Gaukoenigshofen in 1765. In 1933, two chevra kadisha associations and two charitable organizations were active in Gaukoenigshofen. A teacher/chazzan instructed eight schoolchildren in religion. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was wrecked and its furniture and ritual objects were burned; the village head and former fire chief, however, prevented the synagogue itself being burned down. Jewish homes, businesses and the community house were vandalized and looted. Twelve Jewish men were arrested, beaten and taken to Aub, after which five were sent to Dachau. Twenty-two Gaukoenigshofen Jews emigrated and three relocated within Germany. Twenty-nine, the last, were deported to the East in 1942. At least 34 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

Gehaus,1730,298 in 1823,35,"This village community of cattle dealers and small traders developed in the first half of the 19th century. By the 1820s, at which point Jews constituted a third of the total population, the Jewish community had established a synagogue (next to a private residence). Although a Jewish elementary school was founded in 1830, it was incorporated into the village's general school 40 years later. Many Jews and non-Jews, seeking better economic opportunities, left Gehaus during the second half of the 19th century. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 simply accelerated this decades-long process. The synagogue, school, and Jewish-owned stores were vandalized on Pogrom Night, November 1938, and the cemetery was desecrated. The few Jews who still lived in Gehaus in the early 1940s were deported in 1942. The school building was eventually torn down in 1975.

Geinsheim,1723,94 in 1848,15 or 30 (sources differ),"Jews may have lived in Geinsheim as early as the 17th century, but the first record of their presence there is dated 1723. The community established a prayer hall in, at the latest, 1810; after the building had fallen into a state of dilapidation, local Jews built a synagogue on Gaeustrasse. Other communal institutions included a mikveh (1874) and a Jewish school, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who also served as shochet. Burials were conducted in Esslingen and, later, in Hassloch. Two Jewish children received religious instruction in 1931/32. Only three Jewish families lived in Geinsheim at the beginning of the Nazi period. The synagogue’s interior was demolished on Pogrom Night, but the exterior was spared. Later, in October of 1940, as part of the Wagner-Buerckel operation, Geinsheim’s remaining seven Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. Thirty-four local Jews were killed in the Shoah. The synagogue building, which had been sold to the Jewish community of Rheinland-Pfalz in the 1950s, was torn down in the mid-1980s as a result of its dilapidated state. The town of Geinsheim itself no longer exists, and the area is now a district of Neustadt (Neustadt/Weinstrasse).","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=504,504
Geilenkirchen,17th century,168 in 1901,,"Jews settled in Geilenkirchen during the latter half of the 17th century. The community experienced steady growth, from two families in 1710 to 101 members in 1895. In 1869, local Jews inaugurated an impressive, Neo-Romanesque synagogue on Neustrasse (present-day Herzog-Wilhelm-Strasse); attached to the building was a school for religious studies. We also know that the Jewish cemetery on Heinsberger Strasse was in use from 1823 until 1937. In 1932/33, 132 Jews lived in Geilenkirchen. (According to another source, 242 Jews lived in Geilenkirchen in 1933; this number, however, includes the Jews of Huenshoven and Bauchem.) A chevra kadisha (founded in 1828) and a Jewish women’s association (1870) were active in the community. Approximately 10 local Jews emigrated in 1933, and many others emigrated from or relocated within Germany during the following years. On Pogrom Night, SA men from Cologne destroyed the interior of the synagogue and set the building on fire. The remaining Jews were chased to the border of Germany with the Netherlands on the following morning; most returned, only to be expelled to Dueren and Aachen in December 1938, from where they were deported in 1941/42. At least 85 Geilenkirchen Jews were killed in the Shoah. In 1988, a memorial plaque was affixed to the community center on Gerbergasse; a commemorative stone can be found on Herzog-Wilhelm-Strasse.

Gehrden-Ronnenberg,,,,"The Jews of Gehrden-Ronnenberg were predominantly traders (of cattle, leather, wool, textiles and grain) and butchers. Beginning in the mid-1700s, the Gehrden community conducted burials on the outskirts of town (on Koetherberge); the Ronnenberg community, however, maintained its own cemetery. In Gehrden, the community established a synagogue and a school in the early 19th century. Later, in 1850, a new house of worship—the site also included a mikveh, a school and an apartment for a teacher who served as shochet and chazzan—was erected on Steinweg; non-Jewish residents of Gehrden attended the dedication ceremony. Gehrden’s synagogue closed in or around 1920 because community membership was dwindling. The school building was sold and converted into a store; and in 1930, the former synagogue was converted into a residential building. According to records, a Jewish woman served on the local board of the Red Cross in the early 1930s. Jewish property was damaged on Pogrom Night, and the former synagogue was vandalized, its windows broken. Jewish men were arrested, after which many left town. By 1939, in fact, only eight Jews lived in Gehrden and one in Ronnenberg. Restored in 1953, the cemetery has since been repeatedly desecrated. The synagogue building was pulled down in 1979; a memorial plaque was affixed to the new building erected in its place. At least 17 Jews from Gehrden and 15 from Ronnenberg died in the Shoah.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, HU, JG NB1, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=502,502
Geisa,1600,180 in 1861,67,"This small Jewish community, made up of small traders, experienced considerable growth in the 19th century; by 1860, Jews constituted 11% of the general population. Local Jews were engaged in an array of occupations: there were butchers, a watchmaker and even a Jewish doctor. The community maintained a synagogue, a mikveh, a charitable association and a school. The school—it had been opened in 1875—was closed in 1924, after which Jewish children received religious instruction at the general local school. Moritz Goldschmidt, a veteran teacher who died in 1916, achieved local fame as an expert in the region’s geography and history. When World War I began, Jews from Geisa were quick to join the military; four fell in combat. The anti-Jewish boycotts had, by 1938, decimated the town’s Jewish-owned businesses. On Pogrom Night, the few remaining Jewish establishments were vandalized; the synagogue, set on fire after its contents had been strewn in the street, was later destroyed. Twenty local Jews were deported, seven of whom are known to have survived the Shoah and returned to Geisa; they had all, however, emigrated by 1948.

Geldern,11th century,150 in 1862,57,"Records from the period of the Crusades mention a Jewish presence in Geldern. Although Duke Reinald von Geldern protected local Jews during the early 14th century, they were either expelled or murdered in 1339. It was not until 1800 that Jews, most of whom were cattle traders, returned to Geldern. Services were conducted in a prayer room on Gelderstrasse until 1875, when the Jewish community inaugurated a synagogue and mikveh on Nordenwall. Established in 1850, Geldern’s Jewish school was closed in 1914 due to low enrollment numbers. It was in the 1850s, too, that the community acquired burial grounds on Boeckelter Weg. On Pogrom Night, SA men set the synagogue on fire after smearing the benches with tar. The ruins were cleared in 1945. Of the 24 Jews who still lived in Geldern in 1939, 17 were deported to and perished in the extermination camps.

Gelnhausen,13th century,261 in 1835 (7% of the total population),,"Members of Gelnhausen’s medieval Jewish community were massacred in 1349 and expelled in 1576. Founded in the 17th century—Jews were confined to a ghetto until the 18th century—the modern community later developed into a center of Jewish learning. Rabbi Henoch ben Jehuda Loeb, Rabbi Samuel Warburg (died in 1817) and Rabbi Hirsch Levi Kunreuther (died in 1847) were associated with Gelnhausen. By 1835, the Jews of Roth and Altenhasslau had been affiliated with Gelnhausen. A synagogue, built on the Judengasse, or “Jews’ Alley” (today 6 Brentanostrasse) in 1601, was destroyed during the Thirty Years’ War; it was rebuilt in 1656 and enlarged in 1736. The community also maintained a mikveh, a cemetery (1617-1938), a library (1894) and a Jewish school (1836). Teacher Meier Strauss served as teacher and chazzan for 30 years (1887-1917). We also know that Gelnhausen was the seat of a rabbinate until the middle of the 19th century, at which point, in 1847, it was affiliated with the rabbinate of Hanau. In 1932/33, 200 Jews lived in Gelnhausen; by May 1933, their number had dwindled to 162. Five welfare organizations were active in the community, and a teacher—he also served as chazzan and shochet—instructed 20 children in religion. In Gelnhausen, anti-Jewish boycotts were launched in 1932. On the night of June 3, 1938 (a Friday), SA men bricked up the synagogue’s doors; a crowd hurled rocks at the building. Windows in Jewish homes were smashed the following night, and the entrance to a Jewish shop was blocked. All Jews were ordered to leave by September 1938. In July 1938, the synagogue was sold and converted into a storehouse; ritual items were sent to Frankfurt. Gelnhausen was declared “free of Jews” in November 1938, for all had emigrated or moved to other German cities. In 1943, a Jew in who was caught in hiding was sent, via Berlin, to Auschwitz. At least 104 Gelnhausen Jews and four from Altenhasslau perished in the Shoah. A few Jews returned to Gelnhausen after the war, establishing a new community. Between 1981 and 1986, the municipality repaired the synagogue—it had been damaged during the war— and converted it into a community center, to which a memorial plaque has been affixed. Since 2009, more than 35 memorial stumbling stones (Stolpersteine) have been unveiled in memory of Gelnhausen’s Shoah victims.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, FJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=507,507

The community established a prayer room at 92 Loewenstein (a residence) in the early 19th century; although the house was destroyed by fire in 1864, it was quickly rebuilt and used for another 50 years. In 1912, an Art Nouveau-style synagogue of Orthodox orientation was inaugurated on Ahauserstrasse. Other communal institutions included a mikveh (located in a private residence on Rohrig) and a Jewish cemetery on Otto- Hahn-Strasse, the latter of which was consecrated in 1810. In 1935, during a synagogue service, worshippers were attacked by Austrian members of the Nazi Party who were stationed near Gemen. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA men set the synagogue on fire, destroying the interior and roof. The ruins were demolished in 1943. By 1939, 32 Jews had left Gemen.

Gelsenkirchen,early 19th century,"approximately 1,700 in the 1920s",,"In 1812, one Jewish householder was registered in Gelsenkirchen. The Jewish population grew from 96 in 1872 to 1,352 in 1915. The Jews of Gelsenkirchen, most of whom were traders, were initially affiliated with the Jewish community in Wattenscheid. In 1863, local Jews rented their own prayer hall at 34 Hochstrasse (present-day Hauptstrasse); in 1867, they built a community center at 4 Neustrasse (present-day Gildenstrasse); the premises accommodated a prayer room, a mikveh, a classroom and an apartment. In 1874, local Jews established their own community, breaking away from Wattenscheid. Communal institutions included a cemetery on Wanner Strasse (used until 1936) and a synagogue attended by liberal Jews on Neustrasse (presentday Grindelstrasse/Georgstrasse), the latter of which was inaugurated in August of 1885 and seated 256 men and 106 women; an organ was later installed there. Orthodox congregations and associations, the first of which was founded in 1876, established prayer rooms on Arminstrasse, Husemannstrasse, Bahnhofstrasse and Florastrasse. Records also tell us that the community established a Jewish public school at 44 Ringstrasse in 1894 (enlarged in 1907) and a new cemetery in Ueckendorf in 1927. Although anti-Jewish discrimination and violence became routine after the Nazis’ election victories, Jewish cultural life continued to flourish. In 1935, Rabbi Dr. Galliner, who served the community from 1914 until 1939, founded a school for adult education; community members also organized Jewish theater performances and courses in Hebrew and English. Active in Gelsenkirchen were three charities—a Jewish women’s association, a men’s association and a local Jewish Women’s League—a sports club, a youth organization and a branch of the Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers. During the 1930s the mikveh was still functioning and, at one point, 140 children were attending the Jewish public school. On Pogrom Night, rioters vandalized Jewish homes and burned down the synagogue and the adjacent Jewish restaurant. Local Jews were beaten and arrested, and some were sent to Sachsenhausen, where 13 died. Many Jews left Gelsenkirchen after Pogrom Night; Rabbi Galliner immigrated to England in 1939. The remaining Jews were subjected to forced labor in underground construction sites and coal mines. Later, in 1942, 350 local Jews were deported to Riga, 40 to Warsaw and 90 to Theresienstadt. At least 574 Gelsenkirchen Jews perished in the Shoah. After the war, 45 survivors returned to Gelsenkirchen and reestablished the community. In 1958, a community center was opened at 9 Von-der-Recke-Strasse; and in 2007 a new synagogue—it bears a memorial plaque—was consecrated on the site of the destroyed house of worship.

At least 17 Gernsbach Jews, seven Hoerden Jews and two from Gaggenau perished in the Shoah. The residence built on the synagogue ruins was destroyed during a 1944 bombing raid. Another residence was later built there, and a memorial plaque was unveiled at the site in 1985.

Gera,mid-1300s,510 in 1925,378,"Jews lived in Gera sporadically during the 14th and 15th centuries. Expelled from the town in the mid-1400s, they did not return until 1880. The modern community, formed in 1885, established and maintained a small prayer room. With an influx of Jews from Poland, Gera’s Jewish population reached 510 by 1925. The Jews of Gera were mainly involved in commerce; Hermann Tietz, a Polish Jew, founded a small department store that would become a nation-wide chain. Looking for ways to accommodate the growing congregation, the Jewish community convinced the owners of the prestigious Hotel Kronprinz to allow them to build an extension to the hotel that would serve as a synagogue. The owners agreed, and the new synagogue was inaugurated in 1919. The Orthodox Jewish community maintained its own synagogue. Many local Jews emigrated from Germany after the 1933 elections. The two synagogues were vandalized on Pogrom Night, but it was the Orthodox house of worship that was burned down. For obvious reasons, the SS decided to spare the hotel synagogue, choosing, instead, to burn its ritual objects on the street. The hotel was later destroyed during a bombing raid. A memorial plaque has been unveiled at the synagogue and hotel site.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: DJKT, EJL, LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=515,515

Together with the Jews of Platz and Schondra, the Geroda community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In Geroda, a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1910. Two charity associations were active in Geroda in 1933. In 1936/37, prospective immigrants to Palestine received agricultural training in the village. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue interior, community center and Jewish homes were destroyed. All Jewish men under the age of 55 were sent, via Brueckenau, to Dachau, where two of them died. One year later, on the anniversary of Pogrom Night, Jews were taken from their homes and brutally beaten; five were seriously wounded, but several survived due to the intervention of a Christian physician, Dr. Staab. Ten Geroda Jews emigrated and 19 relocated within Germany. Nine local Jews were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in April 1942, and five were sent to Theresienstadt (also via Wuerzburg) in September 1942. At least 22 Geroda Jews perished in the Shoah.

The community’s first synagogue, built in the 18th century, burned down in 1814; in 1816, a new synagogue was inaugurated, together with a Jewish elementary school, at 10-12 Hochstrasse; and in 1887, one year after the Hochstrasse synagogue burned down, the community replaced it with another house of worship (84 seats for men, 40 for women). Although local Jews conducted burials in Weyhers, they were able to maintain a mikveh. The town hosted a district rabbinate from 1840 until 1892. The school was closed down in April 1933. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was ransacked, after which the building was set on fire. The municipality demolished the destroyed synagogue in 1939. Thirty-nine Jews emigrated, 56 relocated within Germany and others left for unknown destinations. In September 1942, three families (the town’s last Jews) were sent to Fulda, from where they were deported to the East. At least 35 Gersfeld Jews perished in the Shoah. Between 1945 and 1947, a community of Jewish displaced persons used the former school building as a synagogue. They emigrated, mainly going to Israel, in 1948.

(The cemetery, we know, was established in 1639.) In 1874, a synagogue was dedicated at 51 Steingrabenstrasse. The community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of shochet and chazzan. In 1933, 14 pupils studied religion in Gerolzhofen. A chevra kadisha, a women’s association and a branch of a Zionist organization were active there. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; its ritual objects and furniture were burned in a bonfire. The cemetery was vandalized, Jews were attacked and their homes were ransacked. The teacher’s wife was forced to wear her husband’s ritual garments and stand by the synagogue’s entrance, where she was brutally mistreated. Jews were arrested, after which the young men were sent to Dachau. On the following Sabbath, the remaining Jews were forced to clean the synagogue. The SS later confiscated the building. Sixty-one Gerolzhofen Jews emigrated, 35 relocated within Germany and, in 1942, 19 were deported to Izbica and six to Theresienstadt. At least 42 Gerolzhofen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Geseke,16th century,174 in 1858,unknown (54 in 1932),"Records indicate that Jews probably lived in Geseke, which was located on the East-West trade route, before the 16th century. Thirteen “protected Jews” lived there in 1700. Between 1750 and 1770, services were conducted in a prayer room. In 1770, the community established a synagogue in a modest, half-timbered house on Steinweg (renovated in 1877 and again in 1931). Geseke was home to two Jewish cemeteries: the first, located on Steintor, was consecrated on an unspecified date; the second, on Ehringhauser Strasse, was in use from 1861 until 1941. Local Jews, many of whom were cattle traders, often faced hostilities from their Christian neighbors, a result, perhaps, of jealously over the fact that by 1820 local Jews controlled most of the town’s commerce. Anti-Jewish riots erupted in 1844. In the winter of 1918/19, soldiers used wood from the synagogue’s floor for heating. On Pogrom Night, SA and SS men smashed the synagogue’s windows and desecrated its Torah scrolls; four Jews were taken into “protective custody.” Later, in 1940, Geseke’s remaining Jews were subjected to forced labor. We also know that 11 local Jews were deported to Auschwitz, Sobibor and other camps. Poet Else Lasker-Schueler’s family lived in Geseke for several generations. As of this writing, at the synagogue site—the building was demolished in 1952—no memorial plaque has been erected.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: AJ, EJL, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=521,521

Local Jews maintained a mikveh and a Jewish school, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. We also know that burials took place in Allersheim. In 1933, three schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from nearby Gaukoenigshofen. By 1937, one-third of Giebelstadt’s Jews were receiving welfare. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects were destroyed. Jewish homes were attacked, a Jewish man was beaten and arrested and another was paraded around neighboring communities on an open-top truck. The synagogue building was demolished in the summer of 1939. Sixteen Giebelstadt Jews emigrated and 11 relocated within Germany. In March 1942, the village’s remaining five Jews were sent to Kitzingen; and in April of that year, they were deported, via Wuerzburg, to Izbica. At least 19 Giebelstadt Jews perished in the Shoah. Between 1945 and 1949, approximately 1,700 displaced persons lived in Giebelstadt (most of them in a DP camp).

Giessen,mid-13th century,"1,035 in 1910",855,"A Jewish presence in Giessen was first recorded in the mid- 13th century. The modern community, founded in the 1720s, peaked in 1910 with 1,035 Jews belonging to the mainstream community and approximately 300 in the separate Orthodox community. The Jews of Heuchelheim and Steinbach were affiliated with Giessen. Giessen, a center of Jewish learning from the 18th century onwards, became home to a district rabbinate in 1842. The community conducted services in prayer rooms until 1867, when a large synagogue was inaugurated; this synagogue was enlarged in 1890 and renovated in 1912. Jews were able to send their children to a Jewish elementary school between 1822 and 1841, after which the community employed a teacher of religion. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated inside the town’s general cemetery in 1836, and in 1897 a community center was built next to the synagogue. Giessen’s Orthodox Jews seceded from the main community in 1887, after which, in 1888, they received a separate plot in the cemetery. The Orthodox community appointed a rabbi in 1896 and inaugurated a synagogue (with 198 seats) in 1899, whose building also housed a classroom and a mikveh. In 1910, the town consecrated a new cemetery with a section for Jews of both communities; the Orthodox Jews, however, received their own section in 1912. Although the University of Giessen was a center of anti- Jewish activity, Jews held approximately 10% its academic positions during the Weimar period. In 1928, a chair for rabbinical scholarship—unique in Germany—was established there. In 1933, Dr. David Sander was district rabbi. The mainstream community had 855 members, the Orthodox community several hundred. One hundred and ninetyseven children (127 from the main community, 70 from the Orthodox community) studied religion. Many Jews were arrested in Giessen during the 1930s, and all Jewish academics and staff members were dismissed from the university. In 1939, the Jews of Wieseck (a district of Giessen town) were affiliated with the Giessen community. Both synagogues were burned down, together with their ritual objects and Torah scrolls, on Pogrom Night. Homes and businesses were ransacked, and Jewish women and children were detained in the police station until evening. The men were held in a Jewish-owned house and then sent to Buchenwald, where one died. Many Jews moved to Giessen after 1933, therefore the Jewish population grew to 1,265 during that period. Four hundred and sixty-five Giessen Jews emigrated, 478 relocated within Germany, 60 left for unknown destinations, 112 passed away and four committed suicide. In March 1939, the remaining Jews were moved to the oldage home, from which they were taken for forced labor in 1941. In 1942/43, 142 local Jews were deported to Poland and to Theresienstadt; several Jews, all of whom were married to Germans, were deported in 1944/45. At least 346 Giessen and Wieseck Jews perished in the Shoah. The new Jewish community, founded in 1976, inaugurated a synagogue in 1997.

Giessen-Wieseck,17th century,unknown,30,"During the second half of 17th century, Wieseck served as the religious center for Jewish villagers from the whole of the region of Hesse; every three years, these Landjuden (rural Jews) held meetings in Wieseck. In 1872 (possibly 1901), Wieseck’s Jewish congregation, which belonged to the liberal rabbinate in Oberhessen/ Giessen, established a 50-seat synagogue on Karl-Brenner Strasse. The community also maintained a Jewish school. Local Jews earned a living as shop owners, livestock traders, or butchers; Wieseck was also home to a Jewish doctor, a dentist, two lawyers and a bank clerk. During the 1920s, Jewish youths were actively involved the Zionist movement. In 1933, 30 Jews lived in Wieseck, soon after which 20 emigrated from Germany: 15 went to the United States, three to South America, one to England and one to Palestine. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters looted the synagogue’s furniture and ritual objects. The synagogue’s new owner eventually rented out the building. In September 1942, Wieseck’s nine remaining Jews were deported to concentration camps in Eastern Europe; their names have been recorded by Yad Vashem.

Spared the fate that befell their co-religionists from Silesia and Bohemia, local Jews (and those of Zuelz) were not expelled from the region in 1582. This fact, coupled with Glogau’s strategic location on the trade route to Russia and Poland, attracted considerable Jewish settlement, so that by the beginning of the 20th century, Glogau had become one of the most affluent Jewish communities in all of Europe. The community had maintained a cemetery and a synagogue since the Middle Ages, but the latter burned down in 1442.

During the 1840s, however, with the advent of emancipation and the ensuing industrial development, young Jews from the surrounding areas moved to Gleiwitz in large numbers. In order to accommodate the growing population, the community built a large Orthodox synagogue with a double gallery, a dome and an eclectic mix of architectural styles; the inauguration ceremony (1861) was attended by many prominent government officials. The old synagogue was converted into a school building, and the community also maintained an elementary school, ran courses in the Hebrew language, an orphanage, a kindergarten, an old-age home, a soup kitchen, and welfare services for the sick and needy. After World War I, a branch of the Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers was opened in Gleiwitz, as were two sports clubs (Bar Kochba and Hakoah) and four Zionist clubs. The community—with which 20 adjacent Jewish communities were affiliated—was home to several industrialists, 12 doctors and 14 lawyers. Although Gleiwitz Jews were protected by the League of Nations’ convention on minority rights until 1937, many had the foresight to leave. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire, Jewish-owned stores and factories were vandalized and hundreds of Jews were detained in the community center; of these, 235 were sent to Buchenwald the next day, where at least six perished. Many local Jews left Germany after Pogrom Night, mainly for South Africa and Latin America. The remaining Jews were forcibly moved into designated “Jews’ Houses,” after which, in 1942, they were deported, in six transports, to the death camps. Several Jews committed suicide before the deportations, and approximately 40 others, all of whom were married to non- Jewish spouses, managed to remain in the city. After the war, approximately 200 Polish Shoah survivors established a new Jewish community in Gleiwitz, but nearly all immigrated to Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The Gleiwitz museum houses a permanent exhibition on the history of Silesian Jewry.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=533,533
Goch,13th century,182 in 1900,unknown (75 in 1932),"Several Jews settled in Goch after the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. According to records, a Jewish community was established there in the 16th century. Local Jews conducted services in a prayer room (on a street called In de Roos) until 1724, when the community inaugurated a synagogue. In 1812, a new house of worship was inaugurated on Herzogenstrasse, next to the Jewish school; the synagogue was enlarged in 1862 and renovated in 1912. We also know that Goch’s old Jewish cemetery, which was located on Hinter der Mauer, was closed in 1800, after which, from the beginning of the 1820s until 1900, burials were conducted at the cemetery on Kalkastrasse. Community membership began to dwindle in the 1920s. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and burned down the building. Jewish-owned shops were damaged, Jewish men were taken into “protective custody,” and the cemetery was desecrated. Later, in 1940, local Jews were forced into designated “Jews’ houses” from which, in October 1941, they were deported to the Lodz and Riga ghettos and to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Forty-three Jews from Goch perished in the Shoah. In 1988, a memorial plaque was unveiled on Herzogenstrasse. A local school bears the name of Leni Valk (born 1933), who perished in the Sobibor extermination camp.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: EJL, JPK-NRW, SG-NRW, SIA, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=536,536
Gleidingen,18th century,95 in 1848,18,"By 1848, most local Jews were traders (of cattle, agricultural produce and textiles) and butchers. The Jewish cemetery on Dammacker was apparently consecrated in the mid-1600s. Records from 1732 mention a teacher, and we also know that in 1837, the community replaced its rented prayer room with a synagogue and school on Thorstrasse. In 1847, a mikveh in a garden was replaced by another, fed by heated spring water. Although the community founded a Jewish school in 1854, unfavorable employment conditions led to frequent replacements of the teacher. Eighteen Jews lived in Gleidingen in 1933; by 1935, that number had increased to approximately 30. Local Jews were arrested on Pogrom Night, and Jewishowned homes and businesses were vandalized. Members of the local SA demolished the synagogue, but we do not know what happened to the ritual objects. The synagogue was sold in 1939 or 1940, by which point 121 Jews lived in the town, among them eight local Jews; the others were Austrian Jews who had been sent to Gleidingen as forced laborers. The cemetery was restored after the war. Gleidingen’s synagogue was pulled down in 1949, and the site was converted into a garden. As of this writing, no memorial has ever been erected there. At least ten Gleidingen Jews perished in the Shoah.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, HU, JH NB1, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=535,535
Goddelau,19th century,34 in 1828,9,"In the early 19th century, the Jewish communities of Goddelau and Wolfskehlen established a joint congregation, of which the Jews of Erfelden were also members until 1877. Burials were conducted in Gross-Gerau. In 1907, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Sackgasse. In Goddelau, Jewish teachers not only instructed Jewish children in religion, but also served as prayer leaders and ritual slaughterers. Five Jewish families lived in Goddelau when the Nazis came to power, soon after which Jews were persecuted by locals and the town authorities. Most Goddelau Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany after 1933, so that in in 1939 only seven Jews lived in the town. On Pogrom Night, SA men from Starkenberg looted and demolished Jewish-owned property; furniture in the synagogue was broken, a Torah scroll was set on fire and windows were smashed in a Jewish home. By the end of 1940, the remaining five Jews were sent to Frankfurt and, from there, to the death camps; in 1942, eight Jews from the local psychiatric hospital were deported to the Nazis’ Hadamar Euthanasia Center, where they were murdered.

Goellheim,Middle Ages (see below),112 in 1850,19,"It is likely that Jews lived in Goellheim during the Middle Ages, but the earliest available record of a Jewish presence there is from the end of the 17th century. The modern community, officially founded in the 18th century, numbered 21 members in 1798, around which time a synagogue was inaugurated in Goellheim. In 1837, local Jews purchased a building on Lebergasse (or Lehrgasse) and established a prayer hall and a schoolroom there. Later, in 1849/50, a new synagogue was built on Berggasse (renovated in 1911/12). We also know that the community maintained a school, a mikveh and a cemetery, the last of which was consecrated on Koenigkreuzstrasse in 1893 and replaced an older cemetery (consecrated in or around 1700). In 1925, 22 Jews lived in Goellheim (1.4% of the total population). A teacher from a neighboring town instructed local Jewish children in religion. Goellheim’s Jewish population figures for 1933 and January of 1938 were 19 and eight, respectively. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night; later, in 1939 or 1941, the building was appropriated by the town. Between 1940 and 1945, one Jew lived in Goellheim. At least six local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was returned to the Jewish community of Rhineland Pfalz after the war. Sold to the municipality in 1970, the dilapidated building was finally torn down in 1971. Memorial stones were unveiled in Goellheim in 1979 and 1988; and a Mauer der Begegnung (a “Meeting Wall”)—it was constructed from the synagogue’s ruins—was unveiled in the center of town.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, LFD-RP, SIA  www.goellheim.de/agenda/agendaweg.htm",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=538,538
Goeppingen,unknown,351 in 1925,314,"In Goeppingen, Jews were murdered during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. Jews returned to the town in 1850, and a community was established there in 1867. In 1874, the rabbinate of Jebenhausen was moved to Goeppingen. Goeppingen grew into an important industrial center, with Jews contributing greatly to its economy. Beginning in 1867, the community maintained a prayer hall. Larger synagogues, built to accommodate the growing congregation, were inaugurated in 1872 and 1881; one of them was renovated and enlarged in 1925. Burials were conducted, beginning in 1904, in a designated section of the general cemetery. We also know that in September 1929, a synagogue service was broadcast on the radio, the first time this ever happened in Germany. In 1933, 314 Jews lived in Goeppingen. Several Jewish associations and branches of national organizations were active there, and 52 pupils received religious instruction. The community maintained a rich social and cultural life even during the Nazi period: in 1936, for example, a Jewish school was opened in Goeppingen. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night; Jewish stores were looted, a Jewish hotel was damaged and all Jewish men were sent to Dachau. In total, 259 local Jews emigrated, 98 relocated inside Germany, 17 died in Goeppingen and 84 in total were deported to Riga, Izbica and Theresienstadt in 1941 and 1942. At least 85 Goeppingen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1971, a plaque was unveiled at the synagogue site, which was named Synagogenplatz (“Synagogue Square”) in 1999.

Goerlitz,13th century,691 in 1885,376,"Records suggest that the 13th-century Jewish community in Goerlitz lived in a designated Judengasse (“Jews’ Alley”). Protected since 1329 by King Johann of Bohemia, the community maintained its own mikveh, a cemetery, and synagogue, the last of which dated back to 1344. Jews were expelled from Goerlitz after the Black Death epidemic and again, by order of a local duke, in 1389. During the following 450 years, only a few “protected” Jews were permitted to settle in the town. The forerunners of the modern community, so-called “mint Jews” from Dresden, purchased land in Goerlitz in the 1750s. The Jewish community, founded in 1850, included Jews from Rothenburg, Lauban and Hoyerswerda. Services were conducted in a private residence on 10 Nicolaistrasse until 1853, when a synagogue was dedicated on Langenstrasse. A new cemetery was consecrated on Biesnitzer Strasse in 1849, and we also know that the community, which had its own rabbi, shochet, chazzan and chevra kadisha, was able to provide children with religious instruction from 1850 onwards. A large Art Nouveau synagogue, built in 1909, was inaugurated on March 11, 1911. The liberal community, however, found it increasingly difficult to gather enough men for a minyan. Goerlitz Jews were mainly merchants, lawyers and medical doctors; many worked in the textile and iron industries. Although many Jews left Goerlitz during and following the economic crisis of the 1920s, the community managed to maintain branches of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith, the Zionist Movement and the Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers. On April 1, 1933, approximately 40 Goerlitz Jews were arrested, among them businessmen, lawyers and physicians. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters demolished Jewish homes, factories and shops; thirty-two Jewish men were arrested and 24 were sent to Sachsenhausen. Attackers burnt parts of the interior of the synagogue. At the beginning of World War II, Jews were forced into “Jews’ houses” on Muehlweg and Steinstrasse; they were eventually sent to the Tomersdorf forced labor camp and, when the camp was dissolved in 1942/43, deported to other destinations. In May 1944, men defined as “half-Jews” by the Nuremberg laws were deported from Goerlitz to forced labor camps in France. At least 75 Goerlitz Jews perished in the Shoah. Approximately 1,000 Jewish men and women were incarcerated at the local Biesnitzer Grund concentration camp, a satellite camp of Gross-Rosen. In 1945, the prisoners were sent on a death march, which many did not survive. A mass grave with 170 bodies was discovered in 1948, after which, in 1951, a memorial to the camp victims was unveiled at the Jewish cemetery, where 323 camp inmates are buried. A memorial plaque was unveiled in Goerlitz in 1988. As of this writing, the new Jewish community, established in 2005, is applying for permission to establish a synagogue on Otto-Mueller-Strasse.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: AJ, EJL, IZOJG, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=540,540
Goettingen,14th century,641 in 1919,475,"Although we do not know how many Jews lived in Goettingen in the 14th century, records do tell us that the town was then home to a synagogue. The modern Jewish community of Goettingen emerged in the 17th century. Most local Jews were merchants or moneylenders, and we also know that some became academics as early as the 18th century. The 18th-century community maintained a synagogue and a school—the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet—in a rented building on Buchstrasse (present-day Prinzenstrasse). The cemetery on Leineberg (present-day Groninger Landstrasse) was consecrated in 1701. In 1872, the community built a new synagogue on Obere/Untere Maschstrasse; later, in 1895, the building’s seating capacity was increased from 200 to 450. The community also maintained a mikveh (built on Rote Strasse in 1899), a chevra kadisha, an historical society, B’nai B’rith lodges (one for men, the other for women) and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith. At the local university, several Jewish student organizations were active. In 1933, in response to anti-Semitic demonstrations and attacks, many Jews left Goettingen. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), Jewish property was vandalized and plundered; the synagogue was set on fire, after which the ruins were pulled down. Local Jews were arrested, the men imprisoned. In 1940, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into designated houses from which most were deported between 1942 and 1945. A new Jewish community emerged in Goettingen after the war. Today, a trade union building stands on the former synagogue site. Several plaques and a memorial commemorate the community.

Goslar,13th century,64 in 1848,38,"The Jewish community of Goslar, which began to develop in the 17th century, was largely made up of peddlers, moneylenders and, later, merchants and manufacturers. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Glockengiesserstrasse in the early 17th century. In 1784, after an older synagogue and mikveh on Piepmaeker Strasse burned down, the community inaugurated a new synagogue—with seven benches for men, two for women—on Baeckerstrasse; the building also housed an apartment for a teacher and a school, the latter of which closed in 1874. Although anti-Semitism was not uncommon in Goslar, Jews were active in the town’s political life. After 1933, however, when the political and social situation became increasingly dire, many Jews left town. On Pogrom Night, members of the SA and of the Nazi party, aided by local residents, broke into and looted Jewish homes and business; the synagogue’s interior was demolished. Local Jews were mistreated and imprisoned, and one died. In 1939, the synagogue and cemetery were sold to the town, the proceeds confiscated. The last Jews of Goslar were deported to concentration camps in 1942 and 1943. At least eight Goslar Jews perished in the Shoah. After World War II, a number of Shoah survivors temporarily settled in Goslar, among them four natives of the town. The synagogue building was pulled down in 1959.

Goldbach,14th century,72 in 1890,38,"By 1715, Goldbach was home to a Jewish community. Hoesbach and Goldbach merged at some point during the 19th century, forming the Jewish community of Goldbach- Hoesbach. In 1818, a synagogue—it also served the Jews of Hoesbach—was inaugurated at 4-6 Sachsenhausen. The community employed a teacher of religion who also served as shochet and chazzan: Herz Gruenebaum held this post from 1859 until 1907. Beginning in the mid-1920s, a teacher from Aschaffenburg instructed Goldbach’s Jewish schoolchildren. Burials were conducted in Schweinheim, but the community was able to maintain its own mikveh. In 1933, 38 Jews lived in Goldbach and 15 in Hoesbach. Three schoolchildren studied religion, and a chevra kadisha and a charitable organization were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and the mikveh were wrecked. Windows in Jewish homes were broken, property was stolen and five Jews were deported to Dachau. Seven Goldbach Jews emigrated and 14 relocated within Germany. In April 1942, 21 were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg); six were deported to Theresienstadt in September 1942.

This small community not only maintained a community center, a mikveh and a schoolroom, but also employed a schoolteacher who served as shochet and chazzan. Burials were conducted in Allersheim. Beginning in 1905, as a result of the decline in the Jewish population, Jews from the surrounding areas attended services in Gossmannsdorf. The community was disbanded in 1938, after which most of the synagogue’s ritual objects were transferred to the Bavarian Jewish community association in Munich. Nevertheless, on Pogrom Night, SA and SS men destroyed Jewish homes and the synagogue. A Torah scroll—it had been stored in a Jewish home—was ripped to pieces, and two Jewish men were detained in the Ochsenfurt prison. Five Jews emigrated from Gossmannsdorf. In 1940, two local Jews were forced to sell their houses and move into a senior citizens’ home in Wuerzburg, from which they were deported in September 1942. Gossmannsdorf’s last two Jews were deported to Izbica, via Kitzingen, in March 1942. At least 22 Gossmannsdorf Jews died in the Shoah.

Gotha,1200,350 in 1930,264,"The history of Jewish Gotha is one of expulsions and returns. We know that Jews lived in Gotha at the start of the 13th century, as records tell us they were expelled in 1212. In 1303, in response to a blood libel rumor, Jews were again expelled from the town. This was followed, fifty years later, by the Black Death massacres. Expelled once again in 1503, Jews were not permitted to return to Gotha until 1768. The modern Jewish community of Gotha, founded in the mid-1800s, established a prayer room, a cemetery and a school. In order to accommodate the growing community, services were moved to a large hall, because the law prohibited the construction of a synagogue. In early 1900, after much cajoling, Jews were granted permission to build a synagogue, inaugurated in 1904; the ceremony was attended by many local dignitaries. Nazi incitement was widespread in Gotha even before 1933, with Jews harassed and their businesses boycotted. In 1931, the city council voted to outlaw kosher slaughterhouses. Emigration accelerated to such an extent that by 1935 the Jewish population of Gotha had dropped to 147 (from 350 just five years earlier). On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was plundered and burned down in front of a cheering crowd; the fire department, in fact, was commended for containing the fire to the synagogue.

Grebenstein,1345,163 in 1849,49,"It was not until the 18th century that Jews, under the protection of local nobles, established a permanent presence in Grebenstein; many members of this early community were fur and textile merchants. By the late 19th century, many local Jews had established themselves as shop owners and livestock traders. The Jews of Grebenstein not only maintained a Jewish women’s organization, but were also active in many local non-Jewish associations. The Jewish communities of Holzhausen and Immenhausen were affiliated with the Grebenstein congregation, which itself was affiliated with the congregation in Kassel. Beginning in 1840, services were conducted at the Jewish school (established in 1832 and closed in 1911). Later, in 1894/95, a new Orthodox synagogue was built on the same spot; the synagogue was financed by the sons of Mayer Goldschmidt, a bank owner and former member of the congregation who had moved to Frankfurt am Main. It was during this period, too, that the Rothschild bank established a fund for poor Jewish families in Grebenstein. The community, however, never had a rabbi, and prayer services were presided over by the teacher/chazzan. We also know that the Jewish cemetery on Burgberg was consecrated in 1850, one year after the community purchased the site. Jews began leaving Grebenstein shortly after the Nazis’ election victories. On Pogrom Night, Grebenstein’s remaining Jewish homes and the synagogue were vandalized and looted; the latter was fully destroyed two years later. By September 1939, all Jews had left the town.

An article, written by the mayor in 1816, revealed that one of the city’s buildings had been used as a synagogue 150 to 200 years earlier. Accordingly, the Jewish community claimed the building, renovated it and converted it into a synagogue. Viewed from the outside, the building looked more like an apartment block than a synagogue. It was also used by the kosher butcher, who converted the rear of the building into a slaughterhouse. Although the mayor prevented the SS from burning down the synagogue on Pogrom Night, the men nevertheless destroyed its interior and threw the ritual articles onto the street.

The Jewish community, established in the 17th or 18th century, conducted services in a prayer room (possibly a modest synagogue) until February of 1866, when the community festively inaugurated a new synagogue, located on a corner lot with the address of 8 Kleinbachstrasse. Construction of this new house of worship had been underway since 1860. Other communal institutions included a Jewish school, a mikveh on Brudergasse (used until approximately 1920) and a cemetery, the last of which was apparently consecrated in 1801. Records suggest that a Jewish teacher was temporarily employed at some point during the 19th century. In 1932/33, a Jewish teacher from Butzbach instructed two children in religion. The Jewish cemetery was desecrated in August 1931. On Pogrom Night, SA troops looted a Jewish home and set the synagogue on fire, destroying the interior and roof.

Griesheim,mid- 17th century,195 in 1853,62,"Records indicate that Griesheim was home to a prayer hall, located in the Judenhof (or “Jews’ yard”), in the late 18th  century. In 1812, the Jewish community built a synagogue at 11 Hintergasse; it was enlarged to accommodate 57 men and 30 women in 1902. Local Jews maintained a mikveh, and, beginning in the late 18th century, employed a teacher of religion who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. We also know that the modern community conducted burials in Gross-Gerau. (An older cemetery was discovered during excavations.) In 1933, five children studied religion in Griesheim. In March of that year, two Jews were summoned to the city council building, where they were severely beaten by Nazis; one was hit with clubs and whips until he collapsed. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was destroyed: Torah scrolls, ritual objects and furniture were burned, and memorial plaques commemorating Jews who fell in World War I were smashed. That night, Otto Loeb’s department store was ransacked by a mob. Many Jews moved to Griesheim after 1933. Twenty-seven Jews emigrated, 40 relocated within Germany, seven passed away and two died in concentration camps. At least eight Griesheim Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was destroyed during a bombing raid in 1944.

Groetzingen,15th century,118 in 1864,20,"In Groetzingen, the seeds of a Jewish community were planted in 1677, after which, in 1699, local Jews established a prayer room in the Mittegasse. The synagogue—it contained 12 benches—was inaugurated on Oberen Gasse (renamed Synagogegasse, or “Synagogue Alley”) in 1799; renovations were carried out in 1814, 1841, 1874 and again in 1899, when a classroom was built. The community consecrated a cemetery in 1899. In 1933, 11 schoolchildren studied religion under the tutelage of an instructor from Obergrombach. A chevra kadisha and a women’s association were active in the town that year. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and windows were destroyed. Its contents were thrown onto the street, and the porcelain inscription above the entrance was smashed. The chazzan saved a Torah scroll by giving it to a pastor for safekeeping; it was returned to the Jewish community in 1978. The synagogue was demolished in 1939. Four local Jews emigrated, three relocated within Germany, one died in Groetzingen and 12 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least nine Groetzingen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1983, a memorial was unveiled near the former synagogue site; two other memorials were unveiled in Groetzingen in 2007.","Daniel Weiss  Sources: AJ, FHJES, FSGH, PK-BW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=553,553
Grombach,1657,70 in 1877,20,"The Jews of Grombach conducted services in a prayer room during the 18th century. Construction of a synagogue (housing a classroom and an apartment) commenced in 1840, but was not completed until 1850. The community employed a teacher of religion who also functioned as a chazzan and shochet until the early 1900s. There was a mikveh in town, and the Jewish dead were buried in Heinsheim. A charitable society was active in 1933, and five schoolchildren received religious instruction that year. By 1937, eight Grombach Jews had relocated within Germany and four had died. In October 1937, when only eight Jews remained, the community was disbanded. On Pogrom Night, a troop of SA men raided the synagogue, demolishing the interior and destroying the roof truss and apartment. A Jewish store was damaged and looted. Seven Grombach Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France, on October 22, 1940. One Jewish woman remained in Grombach after the deportation, but she, too, moved away in March 1941. At least 24 Grombach Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue ruins were demolished in 1963. The town hall (at present-day 63 Ortsstrasse) built in its place includes an original stone from the synagogue, engraved with an inscription from the Book of Isaiah.","Daniel Weiss  Sources: AJ, PK-BW, SHEJGS, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=554,554
Gronau,1803,58 in 1898,44,"The Jewish community of this small town never experienced significant growth. Gronau’s first Jewish prayer room was located in the back room of a private residence. When the community outgrew this room, it became necessary to move to another location. A new building was out of the question, for funds were scant; the alternative, then, was to purchase and renovate an existing house. In 1919, however, three wealthy Jewish families purchased a building for use as a synagogue, but it was not until early 1926 that renovations began. On August 22 of that year, the synagogue was inaugurated. The synagogue was not burned down on Pogrom Night out of concern for the neighboring homes. Instead, Nazis smashed its windows, demolished its interior and ripped the Torah scrolls to shreds. The building remained vacant until it was claimed by the city of Gronau under its re-development plan. A memorial plaque has been unveiled on the site.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=555,555
Gross-Bieberau,early 18th century,121 in 1828,43,"The Jewish community of Gross-Bieberau built a synagogue—with 34 seats for men, 18 for women—on 9 Hauptstrasse (present-day 9 Marktstrasse) in 1873. Local Jews employed a teacher of religion who also functioned as chazzan and shochet, a position held by a teacher from Reinheim after 1930. Burials were conducted in Dieburg until 1891, when the Jews of Gross-Bieberau and Reinheim consecrated a cemetery on Schaumbacher Berg. In 1933, a women’s association, a men’s association (the two were united in February 1933) and a joint branch (maintained with Reinheim) of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active in the community. Although the synagogue had been sold to a local Christian before Pogrom Night, SA troops, aided by 50-60 residents, burned down the synagogue and looted Jewish homes that night. Two men were sent to Buchenwald; one died shortly after his release. Eighteen local Jews emigrated—a married couple managed to take the synagogue’s Torah scrolls with them to Argentina—22 relocated within Germany and three passed away in Gross-Bieberau. By December 1938, no Jews lived there anymore. At least 11 Gross-Bieberau Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue ruins were demolished in 1939.

Gross-Freden,18th century,65 in 1854,see below,"The Jewish community of Gross Freden, of which Jews from Klein Freden and other neighboring villages were members, was largely made up of peddlers, horse traders, butchers and, later, merchants and shopkeepers. In 1858, an older prayer room was replaced by a synagogue—with 50 seats—on Ostenbergstrasse. The community consecrated a cemetery on An der Steingrube in 1890, and we also know that beginning in the early 19th century, Gross Freden was home to a Jewish school whose teachers changed frequently. In 1933, two Jews lived in Gross Freden and 15 in Klein Freden, after which many Jews left the area. In March 1938, the synagogue was sold to an undisclosed buyer; and in October 1938, the cemetery was sold to the Jewish community in Hildesheim. On Pogrom Night, Gross Freden’s remaining Jews were attacked and arrested. Members of the SA threw a burning bale of straw into the former synagogue, but the new owner intervened and prevented the destruction of his property. Jewish homes and properties were damaged and looted by the SA and local citizens. In 1941, a Jewish women in Klein Freden committed suicide. The town’s last Jews were deported to concentration camps in 1942. At least ten Jews from Gross and Klein Freden perished in the Shoah.

Gross-Gerau,1236,210 in 1930,140,"Although a 17th-century synagogue was destroyed in Gross- Gerau during the Thirty Years’ War, it was rebuilt at some point after 1660. By the early 18th century, 60 Jews lived in Gross-Gerau. In 1795, after decades during which the guilds tried to ban Jews from the area, the authorities officially permitted Jews to live and work in the town. Beginning in or around the year 1795, Jewish names appear on tax records. The community established a cemetery on Burggraben in 1600; another synagogue—on community member Aron’s property on Galgenstrasse—in 1741; a new cemetery on Gernsheimer Strasse in 1841; a new prayer hall on Frankfurter Strasse in 1892; and a mikveh, located inside the prayer hall building, in 1894. In 1934, ritual objects were destroyed in the synagogue during a nighttime raid; in 1936, the cemetery was closed, after which the land was cleared and the remains of those buried there were moved to a new location. That same year, services were discontinued at the synagogue. Gustav Hirsch, the congregation’s last chairman, served the community until 1937; Karl Hartogsohn, the last teacher, left Gross-Gerau on January 9, 1936. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were the Torah scrolls and ritual objects from neighboring communities that had been stored there before Pogrom Night. (Torah scrolls from the Gross-Gerau synagogue had been hidden in private homes.) Jewish-owned homes and the Tahara house in the cemetery were destroyed; all Jewish men were arrested and, later, sent to Buchenwald. Approximately 134 Jews immigrated to the United States, Palestine and France; others relocated in Germany. Four Jews died in Gross-Gerau, and four were deported in 1939. Three memorial plaques were later unveiled in Gross- Gerau: one in 1945, another at the former synagogue site and yet another at the municipality building.","Swetlana Frank  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, FJG, LJG, SIA, SIH",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=558,558

In 1740, one year after the authorities finally granted the community permission to build a house of worship, a synagogue was inaugurated in Gross-Karben. The community established a larger synagogue and mikveh at 10 Heldenberger Strasse (with 72 seats for men, 36 for women) in 1840, a new cemetery in 1870 and an elementary school by 1870 (closed in 1928). In 1933, the community still employed a teacher of religion who served as chazzan and shochet. Jews from Rendel, Okarben and Klein- Karben were affiliated with the community. During the daytime on November 9, 1938, before Pogrom Night began, the synagogue was plundered and set on fire; Jewish homes and businesses were ransacked. The next day, Jewish homes were again attacked, and Jewish men were detained and brutally whipped, after which they were deported to Buchenwald. The synagogue ruins were cleared after the pogrom, and the cemetery was sold in 1939. At least 24 local Jews emigrated; others relocated within Germany. Nine Jews were deported to Theresienstadt in September 1942. In February 1945, a Jewish woman married to a Christian was deported, also to Theresienstadt.

Loeb Waller’s residence housed a mikveh and a teacher’s apartment. The community established a Jewish elementary school in 1855 (renovated in 1878): in 1873, 26 students attended classes offered by Samuel Spier from Langendiebach; Julius Schuster was the teacher from 1924 until the disbanding of the school in 1933. Other communal institutions included a synagogue choir, a women’s club, a chevra kadisha and a health fund. Many Jews left town after 1933. Ten Jews died in Gross- Krotzenburg between 1933 and 1939. On Pogrom Night, over 100 residents looted and vandalized Jewish properties, burned holy books and vandalized the cemetery. Jewish men (all 28) were arrested and deported to Buchenwald that night. The furniture in the synagogue was smashed, but the building remained intact. By 1940, no Jews lived in Gross-Krotzenburg. At least 40 local Jews died in the Shoah.

Members of the new community founded various organizations (a chevra kadisha and a sisterhood, for example) and were active in the town’s social life. In 1850, the community purchased several plots of land near the town’s New Market, where most Jewish-owned businesses were located, and built a synagogue there (presentday 5a Plac Zeromskiego). In 1910, this stone building was renovated, and a two-way staircase to the women’s gallery was added to the interior. The Jewish school was merged with the local school in 1874, and we also know that the cemetery, first used in 1830, was located on the outskirts of town (on the road to Gogolin) and housed a morgue. During the early 20th century, the Jews of Gross-Strehlitz had access to a library, youth clubs and several charities. On Pogrom Night, although the synagogue was emptied and its contents publically burned, the building itself was not burned down because of its proximity to a distillery.

Town records from 1802 mention a synagogue (called the Judenschule, or “Jews’ school”) at 17 Kreuzstrasse (formerly Mittelstrasse), and we also know that the ramshackle building was torn down in 1889; in 1891, local Jews inaugurated (on the same site) a new synagogue with a seating capacity of 100. Gross- Zimmern was also home to a school for religious studies and a mikveh. Burials were conducted in Dieburg. In 1933, 71 Jews lived in Gross-Zimmern. Teacher Meier Spier (who served the community from 1883 until 1938) instructed nine children that year. Three Jewish welfare associations—an Israelite women’s association, a men’s association and a youth association—were active in the community. Gross-Zimmern was an anti-Nazi stronghold until 1933. Nevertheless, 44 of its Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany early in the Nazi period, as a result of which the synagogue was shut down in 1934/35. Later, in 1939, the building was converted into a furniture warehouse. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed and six Jewish men were taken to Buchenwald.

Beginning in 1816, services were conducted in a rented prayer room on Fleischerstrasse; thirty years later, still forbidden from founding a congregation or inaugurating a proper synagogue, Gruenberg Jews moved to a larger facility on Niederstrasse. Finally, in 1883, three years after gaining independence from Jewish congregation in Glogau, the Gruenberg Jews built a grand synagogue on Glaserplatz. Jewish-Christian relations were often tense in Gruenberg. Wilhelm Levyson, a local Jew, launched Gruenberg’s first newspaper; his sons later founded a liberal German newspaper, the Berliner Tageblatt. The Jewish population of Gruenberg dwindled during the early 20th century. Accordingly, the school was closed in 1920 and the rabbi’s responsibilities were transferred to an official from Glogau.

Community membership increased steadily during the next 150 years, so that, by 1825, 421 Jews lived in Gruenstadt (10% of the total population); and in 1850, the town was home to just under 500 Jews. The synagogue, a Baroque-style building with a women’s gallery, was established at some point between 1780 and 1790. Although records suggest that the community was quite prosperous by the late 19th century, it was unable to raise funds for the construction of a new synagogue, choosing instead to renovate the existing structure. Local Jews also maintained a cemetery (consecrated in the early 18th century) and a school, the latter of which was attended by 64 children in 1834. The Jewish population declined markedly after the Nazis’ election victories. The boycott of Jewish businesses was enacted early on, windows in Jewish-owned stores were smashed and several businesses were “aryanized.” In Gruenstadt, signs with “Jews Not Wanted Here” sprang up everywhere. On Pogrom Night, by which point the majority of Jews had left town, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; it was not torched, however, for the building was located next to several other structures. Records indicate that the building later housed a business firm. In 1940, only two Jews lived in Gruenstadt. Approximately 29 local Jews were deported to the East.

Guben,14th century,229 in 1884,202,"Although a local duke, by the name of Rudolf, allowed Jews to settle in Guben in 1319, they were expelled in 1348 as a reaction to the duke’s declining fortunes. Another Jewish community was expelled from Guben during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/48. Records suggest that the town was home to a Jewish cemetery as early as the 15th century, but it was not until the 1650s that a stable Jewish presence was established in Guben. By 1834, 31 Jews lived in Guben. Their synagogue, located near the Neisse River (in present-day Poland) was inaugurated in 1837. The community was formally founded 12 years later. More than 200 Jews lived in Guben by the early 1850s, at which point a cemetery was consecrated in Reichenbach (a former village). We also know that a larger synagogue was built on Am Kastaniengraben in 1878. By 1900, most local Jews had established themselves as merchants, lawyers or doctors; prominent Jewish cloth and hat manufacturers also lived in Guben. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were Jewish shops and establishments; Jewish men were assaulted and sent to Sachsenhausen. Later, in 1942, all elderly Jews were deported to the Theresienstadt ghetto. In 1944, 300 Jewish women of Hungarian origin were deported to Guben to perform forced labor in a factory. At least 37 Guben Jews managed to emigrate from Germany. Most of the remaining Jews were deported to the East and perished in the Shoah. The Guben Protestant Church has maintained the Jewish cemetery since 1945; it was, however, desecrated in 1992 and 2000.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, SIA, WDJBG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=571,571
Guerzenich,1653,58 in 1895,50,"The Jewish population of Guerzenich grew steadily during the first half of the 19th century, soon after which, in 1858, an official Jewish community was established in the town. Guerzenich’s first prayer room, established in a private residence—the owners had bequeathed the property to the Jewish community—was used until the early 20th century, by which point the structure had reached a dangerous state of dilapidation. Finally, in 1906, the community inaugurated a new synagogue. On Pogrom Night, when the local fire brigade forbade the incineration of the synagogue, Nazi hoodlums were forced to limit their violence to wrecking the building and desecrating its ritual objects. The building was torn down one month later. A small memorial plaque has been unveiled near the former synagogue site.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=572,572
Guetersloh,1565,145 in 1808,62,"The Jewish population of Guetersloh did not experience considerable growth until 1671. Community records tell us that, in 1721, local Jews established a prayer room in a private house and consecrated a cemetery. This arrangement sufficed until 1765, when the Jewish community was granted permission to build a proper synagogue. For this purpose, a modest building, which also housed a school, was established in Guetersloh; the school, however, was not opened until 1799. Later, when additional space became necessary, a separate school building was built alongside the synagogue. On Pogrom Night, SS men set the synagogue on fire. The caretaker and her son, who were in the building when the SS arrived, barely escaped death. In 1940, the Jewish community was forced to pay for the demolition of the building. Today, a new building stands on the site.

Guestrow,late 1200s,223 in 1860,118,"When Jews first settled in Guestrow in the late 1200s, they built a synagogue and consecrated a cemetery. The anti-Jewish host desecration trials, in which Jews were prosecuted for refusing to convert to Christianity, took place in Guestrow in 1330: 20 Jews were burned at the stake, their belongings were confiscated and the synagogue was converted into a church. It was not until 1819 that a considerable number of Jews were permitted to settle in Guestrow, after which the Jewish population grew quickly, reaching its peak of 223 in 1860. The community’s prayer rooms were unable to accommodate the growing congregation, and in 1829, two days before the Jewish New Year, a new synagogue was inaugurated in the town. Adjacent to the building were a community center and a school. In 1910, the Jewish population of Guestrow began to dwindle, so that it stood at 118 in 1933 (50 in 1937). On Pogrom Night, droves of local residents destroyed the synagogue. Wanting to ensure the complete destruction of the building, they not only doused the interior with fuel, but also sprayed the outside walls; the ensuing fire was so intense that the building burned for over 36 hours. The mob also burned down the Tahara hall in the cemetery and desecrated the headstones. In 1988, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the cemetery.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SIA, WDJMV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=573,573

Those who then settled there established a synagogue and consecrated a cemetery. That house of worship had fallen into disrepair by the early 1900s, and the community inaugurated a new one in 1914. As a result of economic scarcity and the ravages of World War I, Guhrau’s Jewish population dwindled during the early 1900s. During the 1930s, in response to Nazi persecution, Jews again began to leave Guhrau. On Pogrom Night, Nazi rioters set fire to the synagogue and two Jewish businesses. Later, in 1943, the Gestapo ravaged the cemetery and trashed its tombstones; today, with all of the tombstones gone, the area is overgrown with tall grass and weeds.

Guldenthal,early 1800s,50 in 1858,26,"In the mid-1800s, Jews from the small villages of Heddesheim and Guldenthal/Waldhilbersheim founded a Jewish community. Religious services were conducted in a rented room in Guldenthal—less than ideal accommodation, for the room often became overcrowded—until 1910, when the community purchased an inexpensive house and converted it into a synagogue; a modest building, it did not require much renovation. The inauguration ceremony was attended by local dignitaries. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was plundered and destroyed: windows were smashed; doors were broken down; Torah scrolls were ripped into shreds; silver goblets, candelabra, and ornaments were destroyed; and the ark, pulpit, benches and furniture were broken. In 1939, the building was sold to a neighboring resident who bricked up the windows and used the site as a storage facility. The town of Guldenthal took over the building in 1994, after which it was classified as a memorial site.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: AJ, EJL, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=576,576

The Jewish population experienced moderate growth during the 18th century. At no point, however, did local Jews establish an autonomous community, choosing, instead, to be affiliated with the nearby Grevenbroich community, an arrangement that lasted from 1848 to, at the latest, 1938. Gustorf-Gindorf ’s first synagogue, built in 1829, was destroyed in 1834 (as a result of the pogroms in nearby Neuenhoven). A new synagogue was built at another location and inaugurated in 1837.

Guttentag,1742,280 in 1861,38,"The earliest available record of a Jewish settlement in Guttentag is dated 1742. The town’s Jewish population grew steadily, from 120 in 1787 to a peak of 280 in 1861. Most local Jews earned their livings through the petty trades, crafts or agriculture; many left Guttentag as a result of the economic decline of the late 19th century. Built in 1781, the community’s wooden synagogue was destroyed during the fire of 1846. A new house of worship and a mikveh were consecrated in Guttentag in 1848 and 1858, respectively. Other Jewish institutions included a Jewish hospital (founded in the 1820s), a Jewish orphanage (1866) and a Jewish elementary school—it housed two classrooms—(1863 or 1868). In 1933, 38 Jews resided in Guttentag; six children received religious instruction. Active in the community were a rabbi (from Gross-Strehlitz), a chazzan and a Jewish women’s association, the last of which conducted welfare work. We also know that the community maintained a cemetery that year. Although the anti-Jewish boycott was announced on April 1, 1933, it was not until July 1937, that the Nazis enforced their race laws in Guttentag, triggering anti-Jewish riots. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters incinerated the synagogue and damaged a Jewish-owned store in the marketplace. In 1939, Guttentag was home to only 14 Jews, most of whom were deported.

Guntersblum,1548,169 in 1834,40,"The earliest available reference to a synagogue in Guntersblum is dated 1744; later, in 1769/70, the community established a new synagogue at 12 Bleichstrasse (renovated in 1860 or 1862). The Jews of Guntersblum also maintained a cemetery—first documented in 1829 and enlarged in 1893— and a Jewish school, the latter of which was established in 1824 (possibly 1830) and moved to 1 Viehgasse in 1839 (the building also housed a mikveh). The school, however, closed down in 1914, after which the community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. By 1933, synagogue services were no longer held on a regular basis. One day before Pogrom Night, the head of the municipality urged the village’s 12 remaining Jews to flee. On Pogrom Night itself, rioters damaged and partially burned the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects. Three Jewish community leaders who had not managed to escape were forced to march the Torah scrolls through the village as a crowd hurled stones and verbal abuse. At the marketplace, where a prepared pile of wood awaited them, the Jews were forced to burn the scrolls; one man refused, and was accordingly beaten. The three community leaders were arrested, Jewish-owned homes and businesses were ransacked and a Jewish woman was locked inside a chicken coop. One month later, in December 1938, a local resident bought the synagogue building, after which it was used as a storage site. Under Nazi rule, 17 Jews emigrated, 21 relocated within Germany and three, the village’s last, were deported to the East in September 1942. At least 38 Guntersblum Jews perished in the Shoah.

Gunzenhausen,13th century,,184,"Jews were persecuted in Gunzenhausen during anti-Jewish rioting in the 13th and 14th centuries. Although some Jews were expelled from the town during the 16th century—we know for a fact that a synagogue existed there in 1583—a community was eventually re-established there. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Gunzenhausen was home to the rabbinate of the Ansbach principality. Accordingly, the community had great influence on Ansbach Jewry. The modern community established a Jewish elementary school in 1827, a cemetery in 1875, a new synagogue (at Buehringerstrasse) in 1883 and a new school building and community center the following year. Gunzenhausen’s schoolteachers also served as ritual slaughterers and cantors. In 1928, the synagogue’s windows were smashed; one year later, the cemetery was desecrated. Nevertheless, the synagogue and mikveh were renovated in 1932. In 1933, 17 pupils attended the school, and the community ran a number of Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations. An especially brutal pogrom, involving more than 1,000 townspeople, occurred in March 1934: Two Jews died, others were arrested and tortured and a Jewish-owned café was wrecked. The mob leader never served his prison sentence and, in July, murdered a Jew who had testified against him. In November 1938, the synagogue was sold to the municipality. On Pogrom Night, the building was partly damaged; its interior and most of the ritual objects were destroyed. Jewish homes were looted that night. In 1939, the synagogue was converted into a market. During the Nazi period, 52 Gunzenhausen Jews emigrated, 116 relocated within Germany and 11 died in the town; seven were deported to Dachau in late November and December of 1938. By January 1939, no Jews remained in Gunzenhausen. At least 84 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

The school, located inside the synagogue building, at one point had an enrollment of 80 students. Jews and Christians coexisted peacefully in Guttstadt, with four Jews serving on the city council. The Jewish population dwindled swiftly after the Nazis rose to power; by 1928, only 48 Jews lived in the town. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned to the ground, after which the ravaged building was torn down. One Jew, presumably married to an ethnic German, lived in Guttstadt in 1942.

The only available report about the events of Pogrom Night in Haaren tells us that Nazis entered the home, proceeded to the prayer room, threw its contents onto the street and set them on fire.

Prayers were conducted in a privately-owned home that was regularly filled to capacity, for the Jews of Alstadt, Alpenrod, Hirtscheid, Dehlingen, Hoechstenbach, Kirburg, Kroppach and Nister were affiliated with the community. Hachenburg was also home to a mikveh (a new one opened in 1908) and a school for religious studies whose teacher acted as chazzan and shochet.

Hagen,1722,679 in 1930,630,"The first record of a Jewish presence in Hagen is dated 1722. Most local Jews were poor peddlers and farmhands, and their poverty allowed for no more than a small prayer room. Later, as the Jews of Hagen began to prosper and open their own businesses, Jews from other parts of Germany made their way there. In Hagen, many Jews were wealthy and influential, and some were involved in local politics; a member of the Jewish community even served as a city assemblyman for 28 years. The Jewish population began to grow steadily in the early 1900s. Many Orthodox Jews from Poland, called Ostjuden (Eastern European Jews), moved to Hagen during this period, so that by 1933 they made up 30% of the Jewish population. Until the early 1800s, the community of Hagen made do with a “roving” prayer room (situated, each month, in a different house). By 1819, however, they had built a small synagogue, school and a teacher’s apartment. The large influx of Jews necessitated the construction of a larger synagogue, which was built and inaugurated in 1859; a mikveh was built alongside the new house of worship, as was a new school. Many people were unhappy with the synagogue’s architecture and design, claiming that the building resembled a church. The synagogue was renovated and enlarged in 1895, at which point it was re-inaugurated. Anti-Jewish measures were instituted and enforced in Hagen in early 1933: Jewish businesses were boycotted, storefronts were smashed, Jews were assaulted and racist slogans were painted on the synagogue. On Pogrom Night, the SA and SS came out in force, breaking into the synagogue and systematically destroying its furniture and books. Although the building was set on fire, it survived the blaze and served the local police as a beer hall for much of the war (according to records, the building was later destroyed during a wartime bombing raid). It was on Pogrom Night, too, that the Jewish cemetery was desecrated. A new synagogue was inaugurated on the same site in 1960.

Torn down after the pogrom, the synagogue was handed over to the Reich Association for German Jews and, later, to the Finance Ministry. The building was returned to the Jewish community of Rhineland-Pfalz in January 1950, and sold five years later. The new owners built a residential property in its place. Hagenbach’s Jewish cemetery was desecrated again in 1978.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: AJ, EJL, FJG, SG-RPS, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=590,590
Hahnheim,1723 (two families),90 in 1878 (14.3% of the total population),17,"Records suggest that the Jews of Hahnheim may have established a prayer room in the early 19th century. We know for certain, however, that the community opened a cemetery and a synagogue in 1840, the latter of which was built on the Synagogenhof, or “synagogue yard,” (later renamed Freier Platz). The cemetery was vandalized in 1904. By 1933, the Jews of Koengernheim, Mommenheim and Selzen had been affiliated with the Hahnheim community. One day after Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue building on fire; fuelled with goods and utensils looted from Jewish homes and businesses, the blaze, by the time it died out, had gutted the entire building. The synagogue’s ruins were cleared shortly after the pogrom. The cellar roof, however, which protruded one meter above ground level, remained intact, and was later used as a podium for Naziorganized public events; the cellar itself was used for storing water. Four converts were the only Jews to remain in Hahnheim after Pogrom Night. At least three Hahnheim Jews perished in the Shoah. Hahnheim’s Jewish cemetery was destroyed in 1944, after which the headstones were used to construct an anti-tank trap. The cemetery was rebuilt after the war, and a memorial stone was unveiled there in 1981.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-HNF, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=592,592
Hagenow,1784,approximately 80 in or around 1828,9,"The earliest available documents of a Jewish presence in Hagenow are dated 1764. Between 16 and 18 Jewish families lived in Hagenow in 1828. The community conducted services in a prayer room until 1828, when a synagogue was inaugurated on Hagenstrasse, part of a three-building complex that included a community center (where the school for religious studies was located), a mikveh and an apartment for a teacher. According to records, local Jews consecrated a cemetery on Paetower Strasse in 1806. In 1907, as a result of low community membership numbers, the synagogue was shut down. The building was used for different purposes and sold in 1942. In 1933, nine or 11 Jews lived in Hagenow. Although the synagogue was set on fire on Pogrom Night, neighbors extinguished the blaze. After the pogrom, a Jewish family and a Jewish physician remained in Hagenow; the family was deported to Auschwitz in 1942. At least two Hagenow Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1988, a plaque was unveiled at the front of the synagogue building, as was a memorial stone on Paetower Strasse. Later, between 2004 and 2009, the complex was converted into a cultural center, where one can find a permanent exhibition on the history of Jewish Hagenow. Stolpersteine (memorial stumbling stones) were unveiled in Hagenow in 2009.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, FJG, LJG, SIA, W-G, YV  polmem-mv.de/ www.freundeskreis-hagenower-museum.de/ www.hagenow.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=591,591

The community established an elementary school in 1821 (it closed in 1924), a cemetery in 1850, a mikveh and, in 1860, a new synagogue with 108 seats for men and 102 for women. In 1933, a chevra kadisha, a women’s association and an association for Jews who observed the Sabbath were active in Hainsfarth. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue building was damaged and its interior and ritual objects destroyed. The cemetery was also descrated that night. Between 1938 and 1941, four Hainsfarth Jews immigrated to the United States and 15 relocated within Germany. In 1942, the village’s eight remaining Jews were forced to move into one building, from which six were deported to Piaski (via Munich) and two to Theresienstadt in 1942 (in April and August, respectively). At least 55 Hainsfarth Jews perished in the Shoah. The cemetery was sold to the municipality in 1943 and returned to the Jewish community after the war, as was the school. The school was sold in 1952 and converted into a residential building; and in 1996, the restored synagogue reopened as a cultural center.

Haigerloch,1343,397 in 1858,213,"The Jews of Haigerloch, first documented in 1343, were murdered in the Black Death pogroms five years later. An organized Jewish community existed there during the 16th century. By 1858, most local Jews were living in the Haag district. Records from 1595 mention a prayer room. The community inaugurated a synagogue at 14 Am Haag in 1783; the house of worship was enlarged in 1839/40 to accommodate 294 seats, and we also know that the building was renovated in 1930. The community not only hosted a rabbinate from 1820 until 1894, but also maintained an elementary school (1823-1939), a mikveh and a cemetery, the last of which was consecrated in Weildorf in the 16th century and closed in 1884. According to records, a regional Jewish cemetery was consecrated in the Haag district in 1802 (enlarged in 1929). In 1933, 213 Jews lived in Haigerloch. Fourteen pupils attended the school, and several Jewish associations and branches of national Jewish organizations were active in the town. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed: windows were smashed, and benches and ritual objects were thrown out. The interiors of the school and mikveh were destroyed, two community functionaries were assaulted, Jewish homes were vandalized and 10 men were sent to Dachau. A year later, on November 10, 1939, most local Jews were imprisoned for two days and tortured, after which, later that year, they were used as forced laborers. At least 53 Jews emigrated from Haigerloch. Between 1940 and 1942, hundreds of Jews from other places in Wuerttemberg were forcibly moved to Haigerloch, from where they were deported to the East. At least 158 Haigerloch Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue and mikveh were sold to the city in 1939. A memorial organization, the Gespraechskreis Ehemalige Synagoge Haigerloch (founded in 1988) bought the building in 1999. In 2004, it was opened to the public as a memorial and a museum of local Jewish history.

Hainstadt,16th century,,38,"Ten or twelve Jewish families lived in Hainstadt by the turn of the 17th century. Hainstadt’s Jewish quarter was located in an area of the city called the Kellerei. The community established the following institutions: a prayer room— it housed a mikveh, private apartments and a kosher slaughterhouse—at present-day 6-8 Hornbacher; a new synagogue on present-day Buchener in 1819; and a new mikveh (built in a private residence) in 1840. We also know that local Jews maintained a Jewish school from the 1830s to 1869, and that burials were conducted in Boedigheim. In 1933, local Jewish children studied religion under the tutelage of a teacher from neighboring Buchen. The community continued to offer numerous cultural and social activities well into the Nazi period: for example, Hainstadt and neighboring Buchen opened a branch of a Zionist organization in 1934. On Pogrom Night, SA men broke into the synagogue, smashed the windows and destroyed furniture and ritual objects. The structure was not damaged severely, but the building was nevertheless later torn down, after which an apartment building was erected on the site. Eighteen Hainstadt Jews emigrated, eight relocated within Germany, seven died in Hainstadt and six were deported to Gurs in October 1940.

Halle on Saale,12th century (second half ),"1,387 in 1910","1,300","The Jews of Halle were persecuted between 1343 and 1348. Expelled from Halle in 1493, Jews did not return to the area until 1688, after which they quickly established a new synagogue. Assur Marx, a bookkeeper at the Polish court, received permission, in 1692-93, to purchase land for a cemetery. Halle’s 19th-century Jewish community opened a new cemetery and synagogue in 1869 and 1870, respectively. The congregation was presumably liberal, for an organ was installed in the synagogue in 1901. We also know that the community maintained a school for religious studies, numerous social organizations, a new synagogue (established in 1927) and a new cemetery (1929). On April 1, 1933, the boycott against all Jewish businesses was implemented in Halle, triggering a mass rally. At least six Jewish professors, 13 lawyers and 41 Jews in public service lost their jobs. By June of that year, Halle’s Jewish population had dropped to 1,086. In 1932/33, the leaders of the community were Hugo Maizer, Max Jovishoff and Dr. Marcus Felixbrodt; the representative committee consisted of 15 members led by W.S. Lewin, Th. Heilbronner and M. Fried; and nine committees dealt with social concerns (culture, welfare, ritual slaughter, accounts, taxes, finance, and day care). The rabbi was Dr. Kuhlberg, and the teachers were Dr. Rubinstein and Heymann K. Kaufmann. Four welfare organizations were active in the community: the Barmherziger Bruederverein, or Compassionate Brotherhood (headed by Herman Weiss); the Germania Loge, or Germania Lodge, (headed by H. Loewendahl); the Israelitischer Frauenverein, or Israelite women’s association, (headed by Flora Schlesinger); and a Bikur Cholim, or association for visiting the sick (headed by Moritz Kratzer). Dora Ettlinger was president of a union of nurses associated with the Germania Loge. Two hundred and fifty children received religious instruction in 1932/33. On Pogrom Night, rioters descended on the “am grossen Berlin” synagogue; there, they ransacked, pillaged and burned the synagogue and its contents (including 14 Torah scrolls, Judaica, the organ and the tapestries). The Tahara hall in the Boelckestrasse cemetery (present-day Dessauer Strasse) was set on fire, the Jewish community center on Germarstrasse was ravaged and Jewish-owned businesses and homes were plundered. One hundred and fifty Jewish men were arrested on Heydrich’s orders: Leo Hirsch, the community leader, and several others were held at the police station; one hundred and twenty-four were sent to Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen. Five hundred and eighty-four Halle Jews emigrated from Germany. Beginning in October 1939, the remaining Jews were subjected to forced labor. Between 1940 and 1942, 17 committed suicide. In 1942, Halle Jews were confined to seven “Jews’ houses,” from which 262 were eventually deported to the East, an ordeal that only 43 survived. At least 422 Halle Jews perished in the Shoah. In July 1944, 92 Jews—they were, presumably, married to Christians—were still living in Halle. The new Jewish community, established in 1947 with 50 members, opened a synagogue in 1953.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: EJL, FJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=596,596
Hallenberg,1566,49 in 1913,48,"Jews lived in Hallenberg as early as 1566, but it was only in the early 1700s that they established a prayer room. Later, when the Jews of Hallenberg aroused the ire of the Christian population by marching through the streets in honor of the dedication of a new Torah scroll, the city authorities responded by forbidding the use of prayer rooms. After numerous unsuccessful attempts, the Jewish community finally convinced the city elders to rescind the prohibition. A proper synagogue was never built in Hallenberg, as the need for one never arose; instead, prayer rooms were established in various private residences. In 1910, a member of the community enlarged his home to accommodate a permanent prayer room. On Pogrom Night, the SS arranged a rally in Hallenberg’s sports complex. At three o’clock in the morning they marched to the aforementioned house, wrecked it and set fire to the prayer room. The house in which the prayer room had been located was eventually torn down. In 2007, the city decided to erect a bronze memorial plaque in the vicinity of the former prayer room.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=597,597
Haltern,early 16th century,76 in 1840,30,"In Haltern, Jewish settlement began in earnest in the early 1700s. In 1703, local Jews purchased a house and converted it into a synagogue; the condition of the house deteriorated with each passing year, and the building was declared uninhabitable in 1859. The community accordingly purchased a new site and commenced construction work on a new synagogue, which was inaugurated on August 24, 1860. (During the construction period, the older, dilapidated building was temporarily repaired, enabling the community to pray there until the completion of the new synagogue.) The Jews of Haltern suffered anti-Semitic violence long before Pogrom Night: Jewish homes were defaced with anti-Semitic slogans, and the synagogue was vandalized on several occasions. Although the synagogue was nearly defunct by 1938, Nazis nevertheless wrecked its interior and burned its contents on Pogrom Night. The building was destroyed in a bombing raid in 1945. At the site, now a garden, a memorial plaque has been unveiled.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=598,598
Hamburg - Wandsbek,1570,285 in 1885,144 or 170,"Although Jews may have resided in Wandsbek in 1570, the earliest record of their presence there is dated 1621, when writs of protection were issued to them. In 1634, King Christian IV of Denmark, who then ruled over the region, granted Jews the right to form a community, soon after which local Jews established a cemetery or a synagogue. The cemetery—it was consecrated on Katunbleiche (at the corner of Koenigsreihe and Litowstrasse) in 1634 or 1675—is one of the oldest Jewish cemeteries in northern Germany. In 1671, when Hamburg and the surrounding area came under French rule, the Jewish communities of Wandsbek, Altona and Hamburg formed a synagogue district. The community was home to some of the most acclaimed rabbis in Ashkenaz: Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschuetz; Rabbi Jacob Emden; and Rabbi Raphael, born Jekuthiel, Kohen. Local Jews had established their own synagogue by 1634. In 1840—the three communities had ended their centuries-long cooperation in 1810—the independent Jewish community of Wandsbek built a synagogue on present-day Koenigstrasse. Other communal institutions included a Jewish school (founded in 1876) and a cemetery (opened in 1887). The community hired a rabbi in 1858. The Jewish population in June 1933 was either 144 or 170 (sources provided differing population figures). Several Jewish associations were active in the community, most notably a branch of the German Zionist organization. The anti-Jewish boycott forced most Jewish businessmen to sell, after which Jewish emigration from Germany accelerated. The last synagogue service was held in October 1938. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior, desecrated the cemetery and looted Jewish-owned stores. The 129 Jews who still lived in Wandsbek in 1939 were deported during and after 1941. Ninety-two local Jews perished in the Shoah. At the synagogue site—the building was torn down in 1975—a memorial plaque was later unveiled; the cemetery is now protected as a historical monument.

Hamm,1296 bzw. 1327,"433 in 1933, or 402 in 1911",433,"Jewish presence was first documented in a Hebrew document from 1296: It mentions two Jewish refugees from the town who were killed, probably on Anti-Semitic grounds. In 1327, Bishop Gottfried von Osnabrück granted Jews the right to settle in Hamm. This right, however, was limited to wealthy Jews only, as it was depended on a very expensive “Schutzbrief” (letter of protection) by local authorities. The few Jews living in Hamm were mainly money lenders. They were repeatedly victims of pogroms, and often killed and expelled, as in 1350, when the Bubonic Plague broke out in Hamm, and Jews were accused of well poisoning. During few times in the following centuries, Jewish presence in Hamm was prohibited by law. This changed with Friedrich Willhelm I, King of Prussia, in the 18th century, who granted Jews resident rights in his jurisdiction, including Hamm. The community established a Jewish school in 1722, and a synagogue in 1768 (location unknown). With its growing membership, it temporarily employed Rabbis, and inaugurated a new synagogue 1868 at Kleine Weststrasse. After having to give up the protected 14th century Jewish burial grounds in 1850, the community buried their deaths at a new cemetery at Ostentor. With the Nazis coming to power, there were Anti- Semitic attacks on Jews and Jewish properties, as early as 1933. The boycott of Jewish stores was enforced in Hamm, and a number of Jewish professionals were prohibited from working in their fields. So-called “Ostjuden”, Jews from Eastern Europe living in Germany, were expelled from Hamm in 1938. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was destroyed, but not burned down, due to its proximity to neighboring buildings. The Jewish community had to pay for the damages. It was ultimately demolished at the end of 1938. The homes of Jews were destroyed, and Jews physically attacked. The Heymanfamily was murdered. According to an information plaque at the city museum, 200-300 Jews from Hamm were able to flee abroad in the years following. The rest were deported and murdered by the Nazis. Only a few Jews returned to Hamm after the war. The community dissolved in 1953, and the remaining Jews joined the Jewish community of Dortmund.

Hameln,1277,237 in 1902,133,"The Jewish population of Hameln, always vulnerable to the whims of the ruling classes, fluctuated until the beginning of the 18th century, when the local Jewish congregation was formally affiliated with the rabbinate of nearby Hanover. Glueckel von Hameln (1646-1724), the famous Jewish diarist, was married to a Hameln Jew. The community established a prayer hall (on Backerstrasse) in 1670, a new prayer hall (on Altenmarkstrasse) in or around 1770, and an impressive, Romanesque-style synagogue in 1870. Hameln Jews were initially confined to two professions—cattle dealing and moneylending—but after the 1848 revolution, when restrictions on Jews were removed, they branched out into many other fields; for example, garment manufacturing, wholesale clothing, retail, law and medicine. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 and the subsequent “aryanization” of Jewish-owned businesses crippled the Jewish community of Hameln. Polish Jews were expelled from Hameln in 1938, and on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was set on fire, Jewish homes were vandalized and householders were arrested. A memorial plaque now marks the site of the demolished synagogue building. Of the approximately 100 Hameln Jews, the town’s last, who were deported in 1942, few survived. The new Jewish community of Hameln, rebuilt after the war, established two synagogues: one liberal, the other Orthodox.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: JGL, HNB",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=605,605

On the day of the new synagogue’s inauguration in 1894, the entire town festively marched the Torah scrolls from the old synagogue to the new one. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was systematically destroyed. The Nazis first ravaged the interior by breaking all the furniture and tearing up the Torah scrolls and holy books, after which they demolished the exterior of the building and, finally, set it on fire. The destroyed building was torn down in 1945, and the site remained empty. In 1978, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Pogrom Night, a memorial was unveiled at the synagogue site.

Later, when the Nazis rose to power, only 55 Jews lived in this small town. On Pogrom Night (November 10, 1938), the synagogue and Jewish-owned businesses were destroyed.

Hanau,1313,657 in 1900,600,"Hanau’s first Jews were not only referred to in records as citizens, but were permitted to establish a prayer hall and employ a teacher; a position that was filled by a man named Abraham. The pogrom of 1349, initiated by the nobleman Graf Ulrich, claimed many Jewish lives and forced other Jews out of the area. Individual Jews lived in Hanau during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, but it was only in 1600 that Jews were officially permitted to return to the city, after which they played an important role in developing the city’s economy and new industrial zone (Neustadt). We also know that a Judengasse (“Jews’ Alley”) was eventually built next to the city wall. The Jews of Hanau established a prayer hall in 1362; a cemetery, on Muehltorstrasse, in 1603; a synagogue, on the Judengasse, in 1608 (enlarged in 1922 to accommodate 350 seats and a classroom); a community center—the building housed a social hall, a mikveh, classrooms and a teacher’s apartment—in the 18th century; and, finally, an elementary school on Nuernberger Strasse, in 1890. During the French occupation (1806-1813), Jews were given family names and permitted to live outside the ghetto. Although Hanau’s Jews were granted even more rights in 1823 and again in 1830, the authorities placed restrictions on Jewish moneylending and landownership in 1852. By the mid-19th century, however, 6% of the total population in the Hanau district was Jewish. Many local Jews gained prominence in business and trade during the early 20th century: the Stern Brothers, a private Jewish-owned bank, was the main investor in the city’s diamond industry; Hanau was also home to Jewish-owned mills, cigar factories, butcher shops, bakeries, diamond dealerships and restaurants. Jews were active in media, theatre, law and municipal politics, and many Jewish charities were active in Hanau, among them a branch of the Central Jewish Welfare association (1923), a burial society (1650), a women’s club (1901) and a Jewish youth association. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, the synagogue was burned down; seven Torah scrolls were desecrated and ripped to shreds. Forty Jewish men were deported to Buchenwald; Jewish-owned homes were looted and destroyed that night, as was the cemetery. Most Hanau Jews immigrated to the United States, Palestine, South Africa or other destinations after 1933. Those who remained were deported, together with their rabbi, Dr. H. Gradenwitz, in the deportations of 1938, 1940, 1942 and February 1945. Nineteen Jews lived in Hanau in 1965.

Hammelburg,13th century,172 in 1890,79,"The Jewish community of Hammelburg, one of the oldest in Bavaria, established a synagogue in 1570, a cemetery in 1536, a mikveh in 1604 and a yeshiva at some point during the 17th century. Jews were expelled from Hammelburg in 1671, but the new community (established not long afterwards) built a synagogue and mikveh in 1770. The community also maintained a Jewish school. In 1933, several Jewish associations were active in Hammelburg, including branches of the Zionist movement and of Keren Kayemet (the Jewish National Fund). In 1938, religious services and the use of the cemetery were prohibited. Many Jews were forced to sell their homes at a fraction of their actual value. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was destroyed; its ritual objects were burned. Jewish homes were vandalized, and all Jews, including a baby and an 86-year-old blind man, were imprisoned for two days. Two Jewish men were deported to Dachau. During the Nazi period, 31 Hammelburg Jews emigrated and 49 relocated within Germany. By July 1939, all but two Jews, both of whom were married to Christians, had left Hammelburg. At least 38 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The wall near the former synagogue site bears a memorial inscription.

Hanover,1300,"5,521 in 1925","4,839","Although it is likely that Jews lived in Hanover in the 13th century or earlier, the earliest available record of their presence is dated 1300. The records are strangely silent about the fate of Hanover Jews during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, but it is safe to assume, considering what transpired in the rest of Germany, that local Jews were persecuted in Hanover, too. Hanover’s Old Town was home to a Jewish community from 1371 onwards, but it was not until 1585 that Jews settled in the New Town. The Jewish cemetery on Oberstrasse, consecrated in 1550 and in use until the mid-19th century, is the oldest intact Jewish cemetery in northern Germany. In 1864, the community consecrated a new cemetery on An der Stangriede (used until the 1960s). (The present-day community maintains a cemetery at Burgwedeler Strasse, in the Bothfeld district.) In 1589, one year after local Jews suffered a pogrom, the community’s synagogue was closed down. Jews were expelled from Hanover in 1591, and it was not until the mid-18th century that they were allowed to re-enter the Old Town. This ban did not, however, apply to the New Town, where the Jewish population continued to grow. In 1704, the community inaugurated a synagogue at Auf dem Berge (present-day 16 Bergstrasse/Calenberger Neustadt), after which the state rabbi lived in Hanover. In 1827, a new synagogue was inaugurated on the same site; the building was soon unable to accommodate the growing community, as a result of which the Jews of Hanover inaugurated a new house of worship, on Alten Posthofs Auf dem Berge, in 1870 (Jewish population for 1870: approximately 2,000). In 1876, the community purchased a building at Luetzowstrasse, which housed a Jewish school and administrative offices. Other Jewish institutions included the following: a seminary for Jewish teachers; a Hebrew educational institute; an orphanage; a hospital; several welfare organizations; a local branch of a national Zionist organization; and, finally, several sports clubs, among them Ha-Koah. Hanover was home to several prominent Jews: State Rabbi Dr. Selig Gronemann, who held that post from 1883 until 1914; and Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler, who served as rabbi of Hanover from 1831 until 1845 and was later appointed chief rabbi of Great Britain. Theodor Lessing, the philosopher, was a native of Hanover. The Jewish community continued to grow during the early 20th century, counting 4,540 Jews in 1900 and 5,155 in 1910. At least 760 Hanover Jews fought in World War I, many of them as volunteers; by war’s end, 92 had fallen in combat. In 1925, when the community recorded its peak membership figure, Hanover was home to the largest Jewish community in northern Germany, and to the fifth-largest in Prussia. The hyperinflation of the period financially crippled many Jews, as a result of which hundreds of families received welfare. Nevertheless, a new kindergarten, as well as oldage homes and other institutions, were established during this period. We also know that, between 1920 and 1938, Hanover’s Jewish community published a weekly newspaper called the Nachrichtenblatt. Anti-Semitism, which had become an acute problem during the Weimar period, intensified during the early 1930s. The Nazis’ anti-Jewish boycott went into effect in 1933, five years after which, in October 1938, Jews of Eastern European origin were expelled from Germany. Approximately 17,000 Jews were expelled that month, 484 of whom were from Hanover; among them was the family of Hanover native Herschel Grynzspan, whose assassination of the German diplomat Ernst von Rath was used as a pretext for Pogrom Night. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue (16 Bergstrasse) was incinerated, after which the Jewish community was billed 26,000 Reichsmarks for the demolition costs. The cemetery was destroyed that night, as were 27 Jewish apartments and 94 Jewish-owned businesses. At least 316 Jewish men were arrested and sent to Buchenwald. In late 1938, Jews were pressured to sell their businesses and properties; this process, the so-called “aryanization” of Jewish-owned property, had been completed by January 1939. During the ensuing years, more than 2,000 local Jews were deported to Riga, Warsaw, Trawniki, Auschwitz and Theresienstadt. Of these, only 27 survived the Shoah. After the war, a new community was born in the displaced persons camps in and around Hanover. The present-day community, numbering over 3,000 members, is home to the state rabbinate. Several memorial sites commemorate the rich history of Hanover’s Jewish community.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, JGNB1, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=611,611
Hardheim,1318,158 in 1880,55,"The Jewish community of Hardheim was annihilated in the Black Death pogroms of 1348/1349. We do not know when Jews returned to Hardheim, but records do tell us that the town was home to a synagogue by the year 1679. In 1805, the community built another synagogue (with a schoolroom) in a three-story house; the school was closed in the 1870s. A cemetery was consecrated in 1876, and we also know that the community maintained a mikveh. In 1933, the 55 Jews of Hardheim maintained a chevra kadisha, a women’s society, a youth association and a charity fund. A teacher from Buchen instructed two children in religion. The community continued to offer cultural and social activities well into the Nazi period. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue interior and ritual objects were destroyed; Jewish homes and businesses were not harmed, but nine local Jews were arrested. The synagogue was sold to a private buyer in August 1939. Twenty-eight Jews emigrated, five relocated within Germany, five died in Hardheim and 17, the last, were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940, from where most were deported to the extermination camps. At least 37 Hardheim Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1969, a memorial plaque—originally unveiled in honor of a Hardheim Jew who fell in World War I—was restored.

Harburg,1610,351 in 1905,315,"The Jewish community of Harburg (then an independent village) was established in or around the year 1738, when a prayer room was rented at on a street called am Schippsee. In 1773, a wealthy member of the community acquired a building on am Karnapp and converted it into a synagogue. Due to disputes over the conditions he imposed on the synagogue’s construction and use, the congregation split, reuniting only after the donor’s death. The Jewish cemetery on Schwarzbergstrasse was consecrated in the 17th century. In 1860, one of the synagogue’s walls collapsed, necessitating the construction of a new house of worship. Inaugurated in or around the year 1863, the new synagogue at 15 Eissendorfer Strasse contained conference rooms and a schoolroom, the latter of which was used for religious instruction after 1885. A stage for the choir was built in the synagogue in 1889, and we also know that 24 seats were added to the gallery in 1910. In 1930, the synagogue was enlarged. One year after the Nazis’ election victory, the synagogue’s windows were smashed. Services were discontinued in 1936, and in 1938 the community merged with the Jewish communities of Hamburg, Altona and Wansbek. On Pogrom Night, rioters burned down the synagogue, but not before destroying the interior and stealing ritual objects. The mortuary was burned, the cemetery was desecrated and shops and homes were vandalized. Memorial plaques were later unveiled in Harburg.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=613,613
Harburg,14th century,360 in 1834,13,"The Jews of Harburg began using a prayer room, located in a private house, in the 17th century. The community established a cemetery (together with nearby Jewish communities) in 1671; a synagogue at 8 Egelseestrasse in 1720; and a new synagogue and mikveh, built on the same plot of land on Egelseestrasse, in 1754. Harburg’s Jewish elementary school (1828-1888), located at 15 Egelseestrasse, limited its curriculum to religious studies. After the last teacher left in 1925, Jewish schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from Noerdlingen. The community was disbanded in 1936, after which Harburg’s remaining Jews were affiliated with the community in Noerdlingen; accordingly, the synagogue’s Torah scrolls and ritual objects were transferred there. On Pogrom Night, local residents plundered the synagogue. Later, in 1939, the building was handed over to the Red Cross and subsequently used as a storage facility. During the Nazi period, six Harburg Jews emigrated, three died in Harburg and four relocated within Germany (including three, the last, who were forcibly moved to Augsburg in July 1939). At least 13 Harburg Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building served as a cultural center (1989- 1991) before being sold to a physician.

Hassloch,1722,128 in 1861,63,"Records suggest that the Jews of Hassloch established a prayer room in the 18th century. Although small-scale repairs were carried out on the deteriorating prayer room in 1835, the building was closed for safety reasons in 1846. That same year, a synagogue was opened at 1 Gillergasse: religious services were conducted upstairs, for the lower floor housed a classroom and a residential apartment; the mikveh, located in the yard, was renovated in 1881. Hassloch’s Jewish cemetery and school were founded in 1821 and 1843, respectively (the latter closed down in 1924). In 1933, four children received religious instruction. A women’s association and a branch of the Zionist organization were active in the community. Later, in 1935, the cemetery was desecrated. On Pogrom Night, Nazis wrecked the synagogue’s interior and burned its ritual objects and furnishings in the yard. The building was set on fire twice: the first blaze died out and the second was extinguished by a local man who wanted to protect his neighboring barn. Several Jewish homes were vandalized. Four months later, in March 1939, the synagogue was sold. Almost all Jews left Hassloch before 1940, most managing to emigrate. On October 22, 1940, the remaining three Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least 14 Hassloch Jews perished in the Shoah. After the war, the former synagogue and school were given to the Jewish community of Rhineland-Pfalz. The synagogue was torn down in 1978, and its plot was sold in 1979. The community retained ownership of the school building, to which a memorial plaque was affixed in November 1984.","Bronagh Bowerman Sources: AJ, EJL, FJG, SG-RPS, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=617,617
Hassfurt,13th century,125 in 1910,91,"Jews were persecuted in Hassfurt during the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298 and the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. A permanent Jewish presence was established in the town in the 19th century. In 1888, the community built a synagogue on Schlesinger Strasse; the building also housed a school and mikveh. Jewish burials took place in Kleinsteinbach, and we also know that beginning in the mid-19th century, the community employed a teacher of religion who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, a chevra kadisha and a women’s association were active in Hassfurt. Nine schoolchildren studied religion there. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; Torah scrolls and other ritual items were burned. Jewish homes and stores were vandalized, the school’s furniture and the mikveh were wrecked, and all Jewish men were arrested. During the Nazi period, 34 Hassfurt Jews emigrated and 34 relocated within Germany. In January 1940, however, two Jewish children were still attending lessons in religion. Later, in April 1942, 16 Hassfurt Jews were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg); and in September 1942, the last two were deported to Theresienstadt (also via Wuerzburg).

Haren on Ems,1766,37 in 1885 (6.2% of the total population),28,"Although the Jews of Haren on Ems established a place of worship in the Meyering family home in 1810, they often found it difficult to gather a minyan. A teacher was hired in 1825, but paltry enrollment numbers convinced the community, in 1832, to send its children to the general school; nevertheless, teachers of religious studies (they were usually from Meppen) instructed Jewish children from 1883 until 1930. Although we do not know when Haren’s old Jewish cemetery was established—the records indicate an early date—we know for certain that it was replaced by a new cemetery (located north of the town) in 1907, soon after which, in June of 1909, a synagogue was inaugurated on Zum Pascheberg. The provincial rabbinate was in Emden. On Pogrom Night in November 1938, SA troops and the district’s Nazi leader broke into the synagogue and set it on fire; they then proceeded to ransack Jewish businesses and private property. Jewish men were arrested and interned in Sachsenhausen for several weeks. By the end of 1938, six more Jews had left Haren, of whom five relocated to other places in Germany. Nineteen Jews still lived in Haren in 1939; six were sent to Riga in 1941; and five were moved into a “Jews’ house” in Lingen, from which they were deported to a concentration camp. In all, six local Jews managed to emigrate after 1933 (three to the United States and three to Argentina). We do not know how many local Jews perished in Auschwitz and the concentration camps. A Lutheran church was later built on the former synagogue site. Memorials were unveiled there and at the Jewish cemetery in 1981 and 1988, respectively.

Hattingen,1400,104 in 1924,73,"Jews settled in Hattingen in 1400 and lived there peacefully for nearly a century; in 1498, they were prohibited from living in the town. It was not until the early 1800s that this ban was rescinded, as a result of which a proper Jewish community was established in Hattingen. In 1816, this community built a synagogue, a cemetery and a school. The growth of the Jewish population necessitated the construction of a new synagogue. With the help of a local philanthropist who covered the costs of construction, a new synagogue was built in less than a year and inaugurated in 1872. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was incinerated, but not before the rioters had vandalized the building. As the fire department was under no pressure to respond, several nearby homes also caught fire. The building’s ruins were removed in late 1939.

Hechingen,Middle Ages,809 in 1843,101,"The medieval Jewish community of Hechingen established a synagogue in 1546 and a cemetery in the mid-1600s. Although Jews were allowed to settle permanently in 1701, it was only in 1901 that they received full civil rights. A yeshiva, opened in 1770, was replaced in 1803 by a Beit Midrash, or house of Jewish learning, (the latter closed down in 1850). Between 1780 and 1875, Hechingen was the seat of a rabbinate. The community established a synagogue in the 18th century, two others during the 19th century (closed in 1850 and 1870, respectively) and a Jewish school in the early 1800s. Paul Levy, a local Jew, was a co-founder of the Spartacus League (a Marxist, revolutionary movement), leader of the Communist Party and, later, of the Social Democratic party. The synagogue’s interior and a shop were destroyed on Pogrom Night; most Jewish men were sent to Dachau. The cemetery was destroyed during the war, and we also know that 53 Hechingen Jews left the town, 16 died there, one committed suicide and 32 were deported in 1941/1942. At least 37 Hechingen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1991, the synagogue building was rebuilt as a cultural center, housing an exhibition on Hechingen’s Jewish history.

Heddernheim,Middle Ages (perhaps earlier),,,"During the early 1840s, the Jewish community of Heddernheim was the largest in the Nassau duchy. Heddernheim was incorporated into Frankfurt in 1910, but the community retained its independence. In 1760, local Jews replaced an old synagogue, possibly built the 16th century, with a new synagogue at 33 Alt-Heddernheim (renovated in 1923); in front of the synagogue stood a community center whose building housed a schoolroom and an apartment for a teacher, who also served as chazzan and shochet. The Jews of Heddernheim maintained a mikveh and a 14th-century (1376) cemetery; after the old cemetery was filled to capacity, burials were conducted in the cemeteries of the affiliated communities of Niederursel and Roedelheim. In 1840, a new cemetery was consecrated in Heddernheim, after which, in 1843, the old cemetery was sold. By 1928, synagogue services were held only on the High Holidays. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night; Jewish-owned businesses and homes were vandalized. Heddernheim’s remaining Jews were moved into designated “Jews’ houses,” from which they were deported between 1941 and 1943. At least 12 Heddernheim Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial plaque was later unveiled at the former synagogue site (demolished in 1943).

Heidelberg,13th century,"1,412 in 1925","1,102","The Jewish community of Heidelberg was annihilated in 1348/49; in 1390, another community was expelled together with all Jews from the Palatinate region. In 1660, several Jewish families were again living in the city, and in 1724 Jews were admitted to Heidelberg University. The medieval Jewish community maintained a synagogue and a cemetery, the latter of which was cleared in 1391. A prayer hall was used from in the late 17th century onwards, and in 1737 a synagogue was inaugurated at Mantelgasse; the synagogue was rebuilt and enlarged in 1878, in 1934 and on several other occasions. The community was home to a district rabbinate and, after 1921, an Orthodox association. We also know that local Jews inaugurated a synagogue and mikveh (at 35 Ploeck) in 1932, and that the city was home to three Jewish cemeteries, the most recent of which was consecrated in 1876. Many Jewish students from Russia, including the poet Saul Tschernichovsky, the historian Joseph Klausner and the Zionist leader Nachum Goldman, moved to Heidelberg. Nobel Prize Laureate Otto Meyerhof taught at the university. The Jewish community of 1933 (1,102 members) employed Fritz Pinkuss as its chief rabbi. One hundred and seventy-five schoolchildren studied religion under the guidance of two teachers who also performed the duties of cantors. In April 1933, all Jewish university professors and lecturers were dismissed from their posts; in 1934/35, all Jewish pupils were segregated from their Christian peers, a policy that triggered, in 1937, the creation of a regional Jewish school. Rabbi Pinkuss emigrated in 1936, after which Ulrich Steuer became chief rabbi. Eight Polish Jews were deported to Poland in 1939, followed by six others in 1939. The Mantelgasse synagogue was incinerated on Pogrom Night; one week later, the Torah scrolls and ritual articles were transferred from the police station to the university, where they, too, were set on fire. The community house, the Orthodox synagogue and the prayer room were also destroyed, as were many Jewish homes and stores. All male Jews were arrested, and 150 were sent to Dachau. After the pogrom, Jews were forced to clean the streets. In 1939, the synagogue ruins were cleared at the community’s expanse. The municipality appropriated the site in 1942, and the Orthodox synagogue was demolished in 1959. Approximately 800 Jews fled Heidelberg; 121 died in the city; 281 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940; 11 were deported to Theresienstadt in August 1942; and 22 were deported to the same destination in February 1945. Evangelical pastor Hermann Maas smuggled abroad approximately 100 Jews, a heroic act for which he was recognized by Yad Vashem as a “Righteous among the Nations.” At least 288 Heidelberg Jews perished in the Shoah.

In 1628, the town became home to both a district rabbinate and the rabbinical court for the Wuerzburg region. Several famous rabbis served in Heidingsfeld before 1816 (the year in which the rabbinate was moved to Wuerzburg). Heidingsfeld’s synagogue was built on the Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”) at some point between 1693 and 1698. A cemetery was established in 1811, and the community also maintained a mikveh and an elementary school. In the 1920s, a Jewish woman named Herta Mannheimer was the only female member of the town council. Five pupils attended the school in 1933. The community was eventually disbanded in June 1937, after which the eight remaining families joined the Jewish community of Wuerzburg. The synagogue building was burned down on Pogrom Night. Jewish homes were damaged, and two Jewish men were deported to Buchenwald. At least 19 Heidingsfeld Jews perished in the Shoah.

Heilbronn,11th century,994 in 1885,790,"A Jewish community existed in Heilbronn during the second half of the 11th century. Local Jews were persecuted in 1298 and annihilated in 1348/49. Although a new Jewish presence was established there in 1359, it was short-lived, for Jews were expelled from the city in 1476. The seeds of the modern community were planted in 1831, when a considerable number of Jews moved to Heilbronn, belonging, at first, to the Sontheim community.

The modern community established a prayer hall in 1857, a district rabbinate in 1867, a cemetery in 1867/68 and a synagogue in 1877. Heilbronn’s Orthodox Jews founded the Jeshurun congregation in 1910; the congregation—it employed its own rabbi—maintained a prayer room at 7 Uhlandstrasse (50 seats for men, 20 for women) and a mikveh, the latter of which was built in 1920. In 1933, Max Bermann was the district rabbi, and two teachers instructed 188 children in religion. The Jeshurun congregation employed its own teacher for the benefit of 17 children. Many Jewish associations and branches of national organizations were active in Heilbronn. That year, local SA troops became notorious for searching Jewish houses, arresting Jews and brutally assaulting Jewish men, as a result of which several died. In response to the segregation of Jewish and Christian pupils, the community opened a Jewish school in 1936. Nine Polish Jews were deported to Poland in October 1938. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down and the cemetery desecrated. The interior of the Orthodox prayer room was destroyed; Torah scrolls and prayer books were ripped into shreds. The community center, the school, the mikveh and Jewish properties were plundered, and all Jewish men (except the elderly) were sent to Dachau.

In 1842/43, the Jews of Heinebach converted a farmhouse on Eisfeldstrasse into a synagogue; the building accommodated 51 seats for men, 41 for women, a school—it served as an elementary school between 1865 and 1912—and lodgings for a teacher. The synagogue was renovated in 1929. In 1933, the Chewras Noschim welfare organization (established in 1850) was active in the community. Records from 1931/32 tell us that a teacher from Baumbach instructed 13 pupils, some of whom were from Beisefoerth and Binsfoerth, that year. In 1935, windows in Jewish homes and the synagogue were smashed; Jewish cattle traders were assaulted. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), Nazis (including members of the SA) destroyed the synagogue’s interior and school. Jewish homes were vandalized, and an ill Jewish woman was assaulted. Many Jewish men were sent, via Breitenau and Kassel, to Buchenwald. Fifteen Jews lived in Heinebach in 1939. By 1940, many Jews had moved to other German cities; 21 had immigrated to the United States and to Palestine. The remaining Jews were deported in 1941/42. At least 37 Heinebach Jews perished in the Shoah. The municipality purchased the synagogue in 1940, after which French POWs were temporarily accommodated there. Converted into apartments in 1942, the building, now a designated historical monument, has been renovated on several occasions.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, SGJGH, SIA  www.heinebach.de/geschichte/Juden.htm",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=627,627
Heldenbergen,17th century (possibly 16th),261 in 1861 (18.1% of total population),87,"Established in the 16th or 17th century, Heldenbergen’s Jewish community numbered 101 members in 1804. The community’s synagogue (on Winkel zur Straubelgasse) was first documented in 1772. A new synagogue was built at 10 Bahnhofstrasse in 1836, accommodating 62 seats for men and 35 for women. Heldenbergen was home to a mikveh and a Jewish school, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher by the name of Wertheimer from 1863 until 1919. We also know that the community consecrated two cemeteries: one in 1818, the other—on Friedberger Strasse— in 1882 (desecrated in 1891). In 1933, 87 Jews lived in Heldenbergen. Several Jewish associations conducted religious, cultural and welfare activities. Although we do not know how many children studied religion that year, the records tell us that in 1931/32, the teacher (he also served as chazzan and shochet) had seven pupils. More than 40 local Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany between 1933 and 1935. On Pogrom Night, SA men destroyed the synagogue; local residents participated in the looting of ritual objects. Jewish homes were damaged, windows were smashed, the cemetery was partially destroyed and Jewish men were deported to Buchenwald. The synagogue’s walls were later torn down, after which the site was given to the adjacent neighbors. Forty Jews lived in Heldenbergen in 1939, all of whom were forcibly moved into “Jews’ houses” in 1940. In 1942, fifty Jews were deported from Heldenbergen. At least 77 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1947, the municipality sold many of the Jewish cemetery’s headstones for use as construction material; later, in 1954, when the grounds were restored, 27 surviving headstones were returned to the cemetery. In 1985, a commemorative plaque was affixed to a building at 12 Bahnhofstrasse.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, FJG, SIA  www.nidderau.de/index.php?action=geschichte&id=0",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=629,629
Hellenthal,in approximately 1600,104 in 1924,73,"Although Jews lived in Hellenthal as early as 1600, records suggest that a community was not founded there until 1808. These Jews formed a joint community with Jews in neighboring towns, and implemented a system—used until the late 1800s—whereby prayers were conducted in each community’s prayer room for six months at a time. In 1886, local Jews purchased a plot of land for the purpose of building a synagogue. As financial constraints precluded quick construction, the synagogue was not completed until 1903; it was inaugurated in 1904. The Jews of Hellenthal suffered anti-Semitism long before Pogrom Night; the synagogue’s windows, for example, were smashed on several occasions. On Pogrom Night, Jews were dragged out of their homes and forced to watch the synagogue building burn. All Jewish men were deported to concentration camps that night. The synagogue building was torn down in 1942, and the site is now used by the German National Railway. As of this writing, a memorial to the Jewish community has never been erected in Hellenthal.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=630,630
Hemmerden,1568,39 in 1843,31,"The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Hemmerden is dated 1568, after which records are silent about local Jews until 1728, when the city authorities granted Jakob Isaak a license to trade in priestly garments decorated by wine-staining and bearing the local lord’s coat of arms. It was around this time, too, that Jews were granted the right to conduct services and perform religious rituals. A synagogue was established in 1787 and a cemetery in 1813, but it was not until the mid-1800s that the community was able to build a new house of worship. On October 20, 1859, the Jews of Hemmerden celebrated this accomplishment with a festive inauguration. Although the Nazis had expropriated the synagogue in early 1938, it was nevertheless destroyed on Pogrom Night. Concerned about the safety of a nearby fuel depot, the mayor ordered the rioters not to burn down the synagogue. The building served as a prisoner detention center for the duration of the war. Later reconstructed, it is now a warehouse; a section of the building, however, has been restored as a memorial.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: LJG, SIA, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=631,631
Hemsbach,1661,142 in 1846,54,"This community conducted services in a prayer hall until 1845, when local Jews inaugurated a two-story synagogue with offices, a school, a teacher’s residence and a mikveh. The building was financed with the help of Hemsbach’s wealthiest congregant, Karl Meyer von Rothschild, whose family owned property in Hemsbach and had honorary seats in the synagogue. In 1895, damage caused by a fire necessitated the construction of a new roof. We also know that the community conducted burials at the nearby regional Jewish cemetery, consecrated in 1674, and maintained a school between 1836 and 1872. By 1933, several Hemsbach Jews owned important businesses, including a cigarette factory. A chevra kadisha and a women’s association were active there, and a teacher/ chazzan instructed seven schoolchildren in religion. On Pogrom Night, SA men set off an explosion that not only damaged the synagogue structure extensively, but also destroyed prayer books, ritual objects and furnishings. Jewish homes were heavily damaged during the pogrom. Thirty-three Hemsbach Jews emigrated, three relocated within Germany, one died in Hemsbach and 16 were deported to Gurs in October 1940. At least 15 local Jews perished during the Shoah. In 1987, the restored synagogue was opened to the public; it is now used for cultural purposes.

Hennweiler,1680,50 in 1848,unknown,"The Jews of Hennweiler, Schneppenbach and Bruchscheid— Jews from Bruchscheid were affiliated with the Hennweiler community in 1895—are thought to have shared a prayer room in Hennweiler during the second half of the 18th century. The building burned down in a village fire in 1781; the community then established a new prayer room in the home of a Jewish couple. This prayer room was closed down for safety reasons in 1895, after which, despite funding difficulties, the community built a synagogue on Obergasse (inaugurated in 1896). Hennweiler’s first Jewish cemetery is thought to have been located between Hennweiler and Oberhausen, and may have been used by Jews from both villages. Another Jewish cemetery was consecrated in or around the year 1800. Although we do not know how many Jews lived in Hennweiler in 1933, records do tell us that the Jewish population in 1925 was 36. In 1938, headstones were overturned in the Jewish cemetery. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s front door, windows and seats were destroyed; Torah scrolls and ritual objects were burned. The synagogue was later sold to the municipal authorities and used by German soldiers as a shelter and for storing ammunition. The building was converted into a gymnasium after the troops left. Hennweiler’s last Jews left in July and August of 1939. At least 13 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue housed refugees after World War II. In 1951, the Jewish community of Bad Kreuznach granted the local authorities permission to keep the synagogue building, shortly after which the building was sold and demolished. Jewish burials were conducted at the cemetery in 1985 and in 1986.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: AJ, FJG, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=634,634
Heppenheim,14th century,148 in 1890,113,"The Jewish community of Heppenheim, founded in or about 1700, initially conducted services in a prayer hall, but records indicate that the town was home to a synagogue, at Kleine Bachgasse, by 1811. Local Jews established a mikveh in 1715, another in 1842 and a new synagogue, on Bensheimer Weg, in 1900. Burials took place in Alsbach. Jewish schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. Between 1916 and 1938, the famous Jewish philosopher Martin Buber lived in Heppenheim. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s building and contents were set on fire. The walls survived the blaze, but Jewish men were forced to tear them down, after which the men were marched through town and arrested. Property in Jewish homes, including Buber’s 3,000-volume library, was looted or destroyed. Twenty-one Jews moved to Heppenheim after 1933, 76 emigrated, 27 relocated within Germany, 14 passed away in Heppenheim and one committed suicide. Sixteen Jews were deported in 1942; Heppenheim’s last Jew was deported to Auschwitz in 1943. At least 44 local Jews perished in the Shoah. Today, the synagogue site is a memorial. In 2008, a plaque was unveiled in front of a former Jewish-owned store.

Hennef-Geistingen,in or around the year 1300,77 in 1910,43,"The Jewish community of Hennef merged with the communities in nearby Geistingen, Warth and Rott, as none of them possessed the finances required for the maintenance of a private synagogue. This cooperation continued from 1864 until 1887, after which the joint community was comprised of only Hennef and Geistingen. Together, those two communities built a synagogue in Hennef. The inauguration in 1862 was a festive one, with many rabbinic luminaries and local dignitaries in attendance. The mayor of Hennef, also present at the ceremony, offered his blessings. On the morning of November 9, 1938—before the violence of Pogrom Night began elsewhere in Germany— impatient SA members gathered at their headquarters and prepared to destroy the synagogue. They were stopped by the Sturmfuehrer, who demanded that they comply with the order that the destruction begin at the same time throughout the country: namely, later that night. Accordingly, the synagogue was ransacked and set on fire on Pogrom Night. Forewarned of the impending violence, members of the Jewish congregation were able to remove the Torah scrolls and silver ornaments before the pogrom. The building—it was later restored—now serves as a memorial.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: LJG, SIA, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=633,633
Heppenheim an der Wiese,early 18th century,72 in 1861,30,"The Jewish community of Heppenheim, of which the Jews of Offstein were members, initially attended the synagogues in nearby Horchheim and Gruenstadt; later, religious services were conducted in prayer rooms, located in private residences in Heppenheim. In 1907, the community rented a prayer hall at 24 Wormser Landstrasse. Finally, in 1910/11, a proper synagogue was built on what would later become 103 Dorfgrabenstrasse (formerly called Grabenstrasse); the new synagogue was built with materials from Horchheim’s demolished synagogue. The community maintained a mikveh and a school, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. Heppenheim Jews conducted burials in Dalsheim, in Pfeddersheim (1833-1895) and, after 1895, in their own cemetery (located north of the village). Heppenheim’s synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, and the building was demolished shortly afterwards. The village’s Jewish cemetery was desecrated several times during the Nazi period. Eleven Heppenheim Jews emigrated (nine went to Paraguay) while most of the others relocated within Germany. One was deported to the East in September 1942. At least one Jew from Heppenheim died in the Shoah. The plot on which the synagogue had once stood was later sold to a family, after which a new building was erected there.

Herborn,14th century,124 in 1925,92,"Several impoverished Jewish families lived in Herborn during the early 1800s, but they were often unable to organize a minyan; accordingly, regular services had ceased by 1846. Beset by financial difficulties, the community was not able to hire a teacher until 1869, when the Jews of Bad Ems donated money for the establishment of a school in Herborn (closed in 1933). Until 1875, religious services were conducted in rented locations; and in 1882, with the help of donations, local Jews renovated the prayer room at Am Kornmarkt to include 36 seats for men and 24 for women. Herborn’s Jewish cemetery, which had been consecrated in the early 1800s, was enlarged in 1879 and used until 1936. The synagogue was vandalized during Pogrom Night, after which it was destroyed; Jewish men were sent to Sachsenhausen. Most Herborn Jews immigrated to the United States, Palestine, Africa or European countries; others relocated within Germany. Fourteen local Jews were deported in 1942; at least 22 perished in the death camps. The memorial on Gerichtskoppel (at the Jewish cemetery) commemorates local Jewish victims of the Shoah, as does a plaque affixed to the former synagogue building.

Herford,1306,approximately 280 in or around 1895,191,"Jews were massacred in Herford during the Black Death pogroms of 1349. The town was home to few Jewish families during the 15th and 16th centuries, but records from the mid- 17th century mention the existence of a small community, members of which conducted services in a private residence and buried their dead in the Friedhofstrasse cemetery (consecrated before 1679). Prominent Herford Jews included Salomon Joel Herford (1750-1816), a court Jew. In 1851/52, the Jews of Herford erected a synagogue at 21 Komturstrasse; this house of worship was renovated in 1893, during which time a complex—it housed a school and a community center—was opened in Herford. It was during the 19th century, too, that local Jews, many of whom were involved in the linen trade, enjoyed greater economic opportunities, triggering a growth in community membership. Nevertheless, many Jews left for larger cities after 1914. In 1933, 191 Jews lived in Herford. Active in the community were a women’s association (founded in 1883) and a welfare organization (1886), both of which provided services for the sick and indigent. Rabbi Lewin instructed children in religion until June 1941. On March 28, 1933, members of the SA and SS blocked the entrances to Jewishowned stores, the first of many such discriminatory practices. The synagogue was set on fire in 1934. On Pogrom Night, rioters burned down the synagogue building and ransacked Jewish homes; 14 men were sent to Buchenwald. Later, in 1939/40, the synagogue was torn down. By 1941, approximately 36 Jews had emigrated. The remaining Jews were confined to so-called “Jews’ houses” from which approximately 76 were deported in 1941/42. In 1944/45, 23-25 Herford Jews who were married to ethnic German spouses were deported to the Oberloquiz (Buchenwald) and Elben (Kassel) camps. Founded after the war, the new Jewish community of Herford-Detmold conducted services in the former community center. In 1978, a memorial stone was unveiled on Komturstrasse; and in 1999, a plaque was unveiled in Kleine Markthalle.

In 1933, 30 Jews lived in Hessloch; we do not have a population figure for Monzernheim, but records do tell us that five Jews lived there in 1932. A Jewish welfare organization and a branch of the Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, rioters vandalized the synagogue and destroyed its interior. Sold to the local council in 1939, the building passed into private ownership in 1942. All Jews had left Hessloch before the outbreak of World War II. Many immigrated to the United States; some moved to Worms and Mainz. At least 21 Jews originally from Hessloch and six from Monzernheim perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was later converted into a storage room. In 1986, a commemorative plaque was affixed to the former community hall, opposite the synagogue site.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, IAJGS, PK BAV, PK-HNF, SG-RPS, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=645,645
Heusenstamm,1588,unknown,30-32,"Established in the 15th or 16th century, the Jewish community of Heusenstamm numbered 89 members in 1828 and 1849 (11% of the total population); these population figures include the Jewish residents of nearby Obertshausen. The synagogue on Eckgasse (present-day Kirchstrasse) was established in 1650 and renovated in 1829. In 1880/81, a new synagogue was erected on the same site; the building, which was renovated in 1924, accommodated 34 seats for men and 12 for women. Other communal institutions included a school, a mikveh and a cemetery, the last of which was consecrated in 1669. In 1933, between 30 and 32 Jews lived in Heusenstamm; 16 Jews lived in the affiliated communities of Bieber (14) and Obertshausen (two). Teacher Max Eckmann—he had been hired in 1885—not only instructed five children in religion (1932), but also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. The community maintained a welfare association and a library. We also know that a local Jew was temporarily imprisoned in Osthofen concentration camp in 1933. The synagogue was damaged on Pogrom Night, its ritual objects destroyed. Jewish homes and stores were vandalized, SA men desecrated the cemetery and seven Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Sold after the pogrom, the synagogue was converted into an apartment building. By 1940, only one Jewish family lived in Heusenstamm. Many local Jews emigrated from or relocated inside Germany. At least 29 Heusenstamm Jews perished in the Shoah, as did two from Bieber and three from Obertshausen.

Hildesheim,1347,617 in 1900,515,"Records from the 14th century tell us that Hildesheim was then home to a synagogue (located on the Judengasse, or “Jews’ Alley”). Later, in the mid-15th century, exorbitant taxes forced Jews out of the city, after which the synagogue was torn down and a chapel built on the cemetery site. The Jewish community, reestablished in the 16th century, established a prayer room in a school building on Lappenberg. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Poggenhagen in the mid-17th century, and we also know that another cemetery was later consecrated on Teichstrasse. It was not until 1849, however, that the modern Jewish community built its reform-oriented synagogue. By 1933, the community was maintaining a chevra kadisha, a sisterhood, and a history and literature society; later, a Hillel lodge, another sisterhood, a Jewish youth organization, a sports group and a Zionist group (called Brit Haolim) were established in Hildesheim. On Pogrom Night, SS and SA men set the synagogue on fire. (It was not until 1940 that the site was cleared.) Jewish homes and establishments were vandalized that night too, and Jewish men were imprisoned and sent to Buchenwald for several weeks. The Jews of Hildesheim were forced to sell the synagogue property, but the expense of cleaning the site, which was billed to the community, meant that the town paid practically nothing. Thirty students were still attending the Jewish school in 1940, after which enrollment numbers swiftly diminished; records indicate that the school closed in 1942, when the children and their parents were deported. According to a transport list, 51 local Jews were deported to Theresienstadt on July 23, 1942. The community’s memorial book informs us that 103 Hildesheim Jews were either deported or went missing during the Shoah. There were also three or four suicides. In February 1945, approximately 500 prisoners from Bergen-Belsen—most were Hungarian Jews—were imprisoned in Hildesheim’s town hall. It is not known how many of them perished, but six are buried in the cemetery on Peine Strasse. In 1984, a memorial stone commemorating the destroyed synagogue was unveiled in Hildesheim; and in 1988, an elaborate monument was unveiled in the town.

Hildburghausen,1331,130 in 1844,30,"Records from 1331 mention the presence of Jews in Hildburghausen, but beyond the fact that Jews were expelled from the town in the 1400s, not much is known about the town’s early Jewish community. Jews returned to Hildburghausen in the early 1700s. The construction costs of the community’s first synagogue, inaugurated in 1811, were covered by Levi Simon, a prominent local Jew. In the mid-1820s, Simon financed a new and larger synagogue. In response to increasing anti-Semitism, the Jewish population began to dwindle in 1930. In 1933, Nazis forced the Jews to hand over the synagogue to a local branch of a large bank, after which prayer services were conducted in a small building located in the courtyard of a Jewish-owned metalwork factory; and it was this small synagogue that the Nazis vandalized on Pogrom Night. The synagogue building is now a warehouse.

Himbach,unknown,39 in 1905 (8.26% of the total population),28,"The Jewish community of Himbach was established in or around 1849. Available Jewish population figures for Himbach (in addition to those listed above) are 32 in 1879 and 38 in 1900. Jews from the neighboring village of Hainchen, where 15 Jews lived in 1830 and three in 1905, were affiliated with the Himbach community. Although we do not know when the synagogue on Erbsengasse—with 12 seats for men, 12 for women— was established, records do tell us that it was renovated in 1929/30. Local Jews conducted burials in Eckartshausen. (The affiliated community of Hainchen maintained its own Jewish cemetery.) In 1933, 28 Jews (seven families) lived in Himbach, most of whom were cattle traders and merchants. Several Jewish residents died in Himbach, an SA stronghold, before 1938. On Pogrom Night, rioters burned down the synagogue, soon after which the gutted building was pulled down. Nineteen Jews left Himbach in 1938/1939; records suggest that they relocated to Frankfurt am Main and were later deported to the East. By May 1939, all Jews had left Himbach. Two Jewish families from affiliated Hainchen immigrated to the United States and to South America.

Hindenburg/Zabrze,early 19th century,"1,200 in 1933",,"Jews first settled in Zabrze (renamed Hindenburg in 1915, in honor of the Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg; in present-day Zabrze, Poland) in 1825. In 1865, the Jewish community built a synagogue with a seating capacity of 300; later, in 1899, the building was enlarged to accommodate communal offices, classrooms and, in the basement, a mikveh. Local Jews also maintained a cemetery (consecrated in 1871) and, after 1869, an elementary school. The B’nai B’rith organization ran a kindergarten and a day care center in the town. Members of the early community were mainly cattle and grain traders, but Jews later branched out into retail, manufacturing and the professions. The Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith was active in the community, as were a Zionist movement, a sports club and several welfare agencies. Although anti-Semitic incidents were not uncommon in the 1920s, Hindenburg Jews were spared the worst excesses of the Nazi government until 1937, for the town was protected by the League of Nations’ convention on minority rights. The synagogue was broken into during this period, however, and many Hindenburg Jews emigrated from Germany. Courses in Hebrew language were set up, and the various Zionist and non-Zionist groups made a joint effort to counsel would-be immigrants to Palestine. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire, Jewish-owned homes and business were attacked, and many Hindenburg Jews were arrested. In 1942, the 35 remaining Jews were deported to the death camps; Dr. Saul Kaatz, the congregation’s first rabbi—he had been appointed in 1895—was among this group.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=650,650
Hirschaid,15th century,83 in 1812 (13.7% of the total population),64,"In 1851, the Jews of Hirschaid replaced their 18th-century prayer room and mikveh, which had been established in a private home in 1735, with a new synagogue. Hirschaid was home to a Jewish school, the last of its kind in Franconia, from the 19th century until 1924. The communities of Hirschaid and Buttenheim owned a joint cemetery in Buttenheim. When the Buttenheim community was dissolved, its members joined Hirschaid, forming the Jewish community of Hirschaid-Buttenheim. In 1933, the community employed a teacher of religion (he instructed five pupils) who also performed the duties of chazzan. A women’s chevra kadisha was active in Hirschaid that year. On Pogrom Night, SA men from Bamberg set fire to the synagogue; six or eight Jewish men were arrested and sent to Dachau. The sy זnagogue site and the school building were later confiscated by the local authorities. By May 1939, only four Jews still lived in Hirschaid. Of these, one left in 1940 and another was deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in 1942. The fate of the two Jews still living in Hirschaid in November 1942, remains unknown.

Hirschberg,14th century,450 in 1880,unknown (1931,"Several Jews lived in Hirschberg (present-day Jelenia Góra) in the late 18th century, and a functioning Jewish community was established there in the early 1800s. The emancipation edict of 1812 (at which point 35 Jews lived in Hirschberg) triggered the formation of an official Jewish congregation. The community consecrated a cemetery in 1820, a synagogue in 1853, and a new cemetery in 1880. Jews from the villages of Agnetendorf, Krummhuebel, Schmiedeberg, Hermsdorf, Schreiberhau, Schoenau an der Kazbach and Hohenwiese were affiliated with the district synagogue of Hirschberg. A chevra kadisha, a Jewish sisterhood and a children’s hostel, the last of which was opened in the 20th century, served the welfare needs of the community. It was during the 20th century, too, that the Jewish population began to dwindle, a process that was obviously accelerated after the Nazis’ election victories. In 1934, three local Jews and the Christian wife of a Jew were murdered by SS men after having been arrested, along with others, on suspicion of opposition to the regime. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), stormtroopers destroyed the synagogue, desecrated the cemetery and vandalized Jewish-owned homes and businesses. During the following years, Hirschberg Jews were deported to Polish territories under Nazi control, and from there to the death camps. Hirschberg was the birthplace of the German-Jewish philosopher and writer Karl Joel, who managed to leave for Switzerland in time; he died in 1934.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources EJL, LJG, FJG  www.sztetl.org.pl",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=652,652
Hochneukirch,18th century,60 in the 19th century,20 (see below),"The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Hochneukirch is from the mid-18th century. Most local Jews were peddlers and livestock traders. The community attended services in neighboring synagogues until August 15, 1902, when it inaugurated a small synagogue on Weidenstrasse (present-day Von-Werth- Strasse). The Jewish cemetery on Am Stromberg had been consecrated in 1824. Sources differ regarding Jewish population figures for 1933. Either 20 or 50 Jews lived there at the beginning of the Nazi period. We know for certain, however, that the Jews of Hochneukirch had been affiliated with the Jewish community of Juechen by 1933. On Pogrom Night (November 10, 1938), the synagogue building was set on fire, Jewish homes were attacked. The synagogue ruins were removed several days later. In all, 27 local Jews were deported to the concentration and extermination camps in Eastern Europe. At least 34 Hochneukirch Jews perished in the Shoah. The Jewish cemetery was desecrated in 1951, as it had been during the Nazi period; there, the last burial took place in 1969, but it was not until 1996 that the cemetery was declared a historical site.

Hochheim,17th century,44 in 1907,23,"Although the Jewish community of Hochheim was always small and poor, it refused, in 1840, to be incorporated into the congregation of nearby Floersheim. Most local Jews were shop owners, livestock traders or butchers. In 1821, there were five Jewish families (18 children) in Hochheim; religious services were held in a dark, dilapidated hall. In 1852, the congregation hired a Jewish teacher from Floersheim. A synagogue with 38 seats for men and 12 for women was set up on the second floor of a 150-year-old house on Rathausstrasse in 1870. Burials were conducted in Floersheim until 1907, when new burial grounds were consecrated in Hochheim (first used in 1912). Sigmund Aschrott, a prominent Jewish-German businessman, was born in Hochheim and spent his childhood there. He not only contributed much to the revival of the linen industry, but also bought land, built splendid parks in Kassel, and invested in many industries. Following Pogrom Night, November 1938, the mayor of Hochheim wrote a report stating that on November 10, at around a quarter past six in the evening, the synagogue had been wrecked, along with two homes and one Jewish-owned business. The cemetery was also destroyed. Most Jews left Hochheim during the years 1934 to 1938; the others had left by 1939. Members of the Allied forces made former Nazis work to restore Hochheim’s Jewish cemetery in 1945.

In 1927, Hochspeyer Jews were allotted a section of the local churchyard on Friedhofstrasse. Thirty-two Jews lived in Hochspeyer in 1932. In 1933, eight Jewish families were registered there.

The community began to grow, together with the population of the rest of the town, in 1863; the stimulus being the opening of a large chemical factory (the predecessor of I.G. Farben). Many Jews prospered in Hoechst: Bruno Asch, for example, attained the position of mayor. The Jewish population grew to 148 by 1900, reaching its peak of 200 just before the Nazis seized power. Repressive anti-Jewish measures, particularly the economic boycott of 1933, triggered a marked decline in the Jewish population. Those who were unable to emigrate by 1942 were deported. Almost no one survived. Religious services were initially conducted in a private residence. In 1806, a prayer room with an adjoining ritual bath was established inside the tower of the northern city wall. When the tower was torn down some 10 years later, a new synagogue was built on its ruins. In response to the population growth of the late 19th century, the community inaugurated another house of worship, seating 138 people, in December 1905. Hoechst Jews were members of the Wiesbaden rabbinical district, and they were predominantly Orthodox. The community maintained a school for religious studies presided over by a teacher of Hebrew, who also performed the duties of shochet and chazzan. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was torched, at first by SA men and, later, by local residents; firemen prevented the blaze from spreading to the surrounding buildings. Most Jewish men were deported to Buchenwald, and what remained of the synagogue was subsequently sold to the city in a mock sale, in which the Jewish community was defrauded of any proceeds.

Several decades later, as a result of financial hardship, some Jewish families from Hoechst immigrated to North America. Hoechst, which belonged to the Orthodox rabbinate in Darmstadt, formed a synagogue association together with Jews in its affiliated villages in 1923. The Jewish community established a synagogue (on Wilhelmstrasse), and a later cemetery, in 1797 and 1899, respectively. In 1904, a new synagogue—with 84 seats for men, 66 for women—was inaugurated; Moses Mai, who was born in Hoechst, covered the bulk of the construction costs.

On Pogrom Night, rioters damaged the synagogue, school and mikveh buildings, destroying the interiors, furniture and ritual objects. The synagogue and school buildings were later confiscated by the municipal authorities. Forty-four local Jews emigrated and 46 relocated within Germany. Hoerstein’s last Jew left in April 1940.

Hoexter,1384,209 in 1885,106,"The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Hoexter is dated 1384. By the mid-17th century, nine Jewish families lived in the town. Consecrated on Nagelschmiedstrasse in 1834 and in use until 1936, the synagogue also housed a schoolroom and an apartment for the teacher. On Pogrom Night, SA and SS men destroyed the interior of the synagogue. Jewish homes were ravaged, Jewish men were beaten and sent to Buchenwald, and the cemetery was ravaged so thoroughly that not a single headstone was left standing. The community sold its synagogue at the beginning of 1939, but the bank account in which the proceeds of the sale were deposited was later confiscated. According to records, cattle were kept in the damaged synagogue building during the winter. Twelve Hoexter Jews perished in the Shoah. Jacob Pins, the famous Israeli woodcut artist, was born in Hoexter in 1917; he immigrated to Palestine in 1936 and died in Jerusalem in 2005, two years after being honored in Hoexter.

Hof,1319,98 in 1910,96,"Hof’s medieval Jewish community lived in the Jewish quarter (documented in 1412) and maintained a rabbinical court and a synagogue, the latter of which was documented in 1373. Jews left Hof when riots broke out in 1515, and it was not until 1902 that an official Jewish community was founded there. Communal institutions included a cemetery, consecrated in Woelbattendorf in 1911, and a synagogue (1927). In 1933, a teacher/chazzan instructed 19 schoolchildren. Active in the community were a women’s chevra kadisha, a welfare organization for transients, a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith and a cultural society. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s furniture and ritual objects were burned on the outskirts of the city; windows in Jewish homes and stores were broken, and 12 Jews were arrested and detained for several weeks in Hof ’s prison. Several weeks later, the synagogue building was demolished at the community’s expense. During the Nazi period, 23 Hof Jews emigrated, 65 relocated within Germany and seven died in Hof. The city’s last Jews left in 1941. At least 25 Hof Jews perished in the Shoah. A commemorative plaque was later unveiled at the former synagogue site.

The Jewish community maintained an elementary school from 1840 until 1876, after which a teacher, who also served as a chazzan and shochet, instructed children in religion. Hoffenheim was home to a Jewish men’s association, a women’s association, an association for the sick and a society called Binyan Bes- Hakneses. We also know that the community had built a mikveh by 1932, and that burials were conducted in Waibstadt. In 1935, local Nazis attacked the synagogue and wounded the shamash (synagogue caretaker); the local evangelical minister denounced these crimes. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA men heavily damaged the synagogue: the chandelier and the windows were smashed, and ritual objects were hauled to the outskirts of town, where they were set on fire. The synagogue ruins were later demolished. Twelve Hoffenheim Jews emigrated, 10 relocated within Germany, three died in the town and 15, the last, were deported to Gurs in October 1940.

At the cemetery site (called Schanzenweg), which had been purchased in 1695, the oldest existing gravestone is dated 1737. Records also tell us that Hofgeismar was home to a Jewish elementary school from 1867 until 1908. In 1848, anti-Semitic rioters attacked local Jews. In 1933, between 31 and 37 Jews lived in Hofgeismar. A teacher from Meimbressen instructed five schoolchildren in religion, and a Jewish women’s association conducted welfare work. In Hofgeismar, a stronghold of the Nazi Party, Nazis held leading positions in the city parliament. During the 1930s, headstones from the Jewish cemetery were used for the lining of a pond. On Pogrom Night, members of the SA and SS destroyed the synagogue’s interior, smashed windows and vandalized Jewish-owned homes and stores. A Jewish man was arrested and mistreated; another managed to escape his attackers. Hofgeismar’s synagogue was torn down shortly after the pogrom. Ten local Jews emigrated from Germany, several moved to other German cities and two died in the town between 1933 and 1935. At least 15 Hofgeismar Jews perished in the Shoah.

In 1920, the Jewish community merged with that of nearby Lendershausen, forming the Jewish community of Hofheim-Lendershausen. Hofheim’s synagogue (it housed a mikveh and a classroom) was established in 1920, when the Lendershausen synagogue closed down. The community employed a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet, and Jewish burials were conducted in Kleinsteinach. In 1933, four schoolchildren studied religion in Hofheim. A Jewish women’s association and a Chevras Bikur Cholim (society for visiting the sick) were still active in the community that year. Later, in 1934, local Nazis revived a blood libel allegation from 1929 (it had originated in nearby Manau) and used it as a pretext to arrest Jews in Hofheim and the surrounding areas; these Jews were imprisoned for several months. On Pogrom Night, a mob of local residents destroyed the synagogue’s furniture, ritual items and mikveh. Several Jews were arrested. All Jews left Hofheim between 1933 and 1940. Sixteen emigrated, 28 relocated within Germany and two, the last (both were from Lendershausen), were moved to Wuerzburg in April 1942, after which they were deported to Izbica.

Although they were permitted to resettle there in 1637, they belonged to the Ailringe community until 1817, when the independent Jewish community of Hohebach was founded. The synagogue on Rathausstrasse, a simple prayer room, was established in the 17th century. The first proper synagogue was built in 1817; in 1840, it was replaced by a new building with a classroom and a teacher’s apartment. The community established a mikveh in 1828, a cemetery in 1852 and a school in 1828 (the school shut down in 1925). Thirty-two Jews lived in Hohebach in 1933. They maintained a chevra kadisha, a women’s association and several charities. A teacher from Kuenzelsau instructed four children. The synagogue was damaged heavily on Pogrom Night: the interior was destroyed, and the ritual objects, holy books, eight Torah scrolls, carpets and curtains were taken away and set on fire. In total, 17 Hohebach Jews emigrated, three relocated within Germany, five died in Hohebach and eight were deported in 1941/42: three to Riga, three to Izbica and two to Theresienstadt.

Thirty-four Jews had left the town by November 1938, by which point prayer services were no longer held in the synagogue. That same month, on Pogrom Night, rioters set the defunct synagogue on fire and destroyed Jewish homes and businesses. Jewish men were sent to concentration camps, and others were taken for forced labor. By 1942, another 21 Jews had left Hohenlimburg. Of the 34 local Jews who moved to other German towns, seven perished in concentration camps. Nine were deported to the East from Hohenlimburg in April of 1942, as were four others on unspecified dates. All perished.

Holzappel’s synagogue, which was located in a privately-owned house, was renovated in 1844. Jewish burials took place in Cramberg until the community consecrated its own burial grounds. In 1932/33, approximately 24 Jews lived in Holzappel, five in Langenscheid and 26 in Isselbach. Eight schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from Diez. Services were conducted only on Saturdays and holidays, alternating between the Holzappel synagogue and a prayer hall in Isselbach. The community took preventative action before Pogrom Night by hiding some of the synagogue’s ritual objects and two Torah scrolls in a community member’s home. On Pogrom Night, SA men destroyed the synagogue’s interior and threw Torah curtains and ritual objects into the yard. Three Jewish homes were ransacked, their inhabitants beaten. All Jews, including women and children, were arrested and detained at the council house. Jewish homes in Isselbach were attacked, and we also know that three men from Holzappel and five from Isselbach were sent to Dachau. After the pogrom, the remaining Torah scrolls and ritual objects were sent abroad for safekeeping. The synagogue building was sold for half its actual value. Holzappel’s remaining Jews were deported in 1941/42; Isselbach’s last Jews were sent to old-age homes in Frankfurt in February 1941. At least 12 Jews originally from Holzappel and 10 from Isselbach perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue was converted into a commercial building.

Holzminden,1557,130 in 1890,84,"Although Jews lived in Holzminden in the 16th century, the modern community emerged in 1736, when a modest prayer hall was established in the home of Isaac Gerson. Other prayer halls were consecrated in Holzminden during the ensuing decades, and in 1836 the community built a large synagogue with a women’s gallery, schoolrooms and an apartment for a teacher. By 1836, members of this moderately prosperous community were involved in many trades, including livestock trading, dry goods, textiles and moneylending. Jews later branched out into other occupations; some entered the banking and railway industries, and the town was home to a Jewish-owned bookbindery and tannery. Local Jews were active in civic life, enlisted in the army during World War I—25 enlisted and four died—and established numerous clubs and organizations, for example, a club for Jewish war veterans and a sports club. Jewish-Christian relations were good in Holzminden, and anti-Semitism was vigorously resisted there during the 1920s. In 1933, however, the nation-wide anti-Jewish boycott ended nearly two centuries of peaceful coexistence. The synagogue interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night, the contents were burned outside. In 1942, Holzminden’s few remaining Jews were deported to the camps, from which only two returned. The synagogue was returned to the Jewish community after the war.

Repairs were carried out after the Shoah and, in 1950, there were 318 gravestones in the older section and 94 in the new; by 1990, however, only 180 remained. Reported acts of vandalism took place in the cemetery in 1947, 1956-57, 1959, 1993 and 1994.

Hueffenhardt,17th century,42 in 1890,17,"This Jewish community maintained a synagogue and school on Reisengasse, but the dates of construction are not known. The Jews of Hueffenhardt conducted burials in Waibstadt, Heinsheim and Bad Rappenau. In 1933, only two children studied religion under the guidance of a teacher from Neckarbischofsheim. The community was disbanded in July 1938. On the morning after Pogrom Night, an order was given to burn down the synagogue, but concern for the safety of the adjacent buildings convinced the authorities to destroy the building using different means. The upper floor was dismantled by dozens of locals, including children who were excused from school for the occasion; the ground floor, too, was wrecked. Furniture was hauled to the outskirts of town and burned, together with scrolls and other ritual objects, in a festive bonfire accompanied by an orchestra. The following day, Jewish-owned businesses were vandalized and local Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Fourteen Hueffenhardt Jews emigrated; one died in the town. Two Jews moved to Karlsruhe in the summer of 1939: they were deported to Gurs in October 1940, and from there to Auschwitz, where they died. At least 10 Hueffenhardt Jews perished in the Shoah.

We also know that, in 1685, another “protected Jew” was permitted to settle in the town. Forty-three Jews lived in Hulchenrath in 1806. Although the community was affiliated with that of Grevenbroich in or around 1858, local Jews continued to conduct services in a private residence. Finally, in 1875, the community inaugurated a new synagogue on Broichstrasse. In May 1928, not long after anti-Semitic rioters destroyed its furniture, the Broichstrasse synagogue was sold to a local resident. The building, however, was nevertheless damaged on Pogrom Night. Eight Huelchenrath Jews perished in the Shoah. Repaired in October 1951, the synagogue later accommodated a slaughterhouse and a sausage factory.

Huels (Krefeld),17th century,122 in 1865,60,"The small Jewish community of Huels (now an urban district of Krefeld) was founded in the 17th century. Established during the community’s early years, Huels’ first synagogue was located in an old and inadequate structure; the congregation unsuccessfully applied for a new building on numerous occasions, but it was only in the 1860s, out of fear that the building would collapse, that the authorities tore down the structure. Services were conducted in the Jewish school until 1893, when, after years of denied requests, the congregation received a new building (on Kleverstrasse) for use as a synagogue. According to records, the community never established its own cemetery. We also know that although the town was home to a Jewish school, Jewish children usually attended the Catholic school. Synagogue services were discontinued in 1920, after which the ritual objects were transferred to the Judaica collection at the Rheinisches Museum. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 10, 1938) rioters not only destroyed the synagogue, but also vandalized Jewish stores and homes. Nine local Jews were deported to Riga, as were 12 to Theresienstadt.

It was in 1868, too, that the community hired a teacher of religious studies, prior to which children had studied religion in Burghaun. The synagogue burned down in a neighborhood fire of 1886, and another fire in 1888 delayed the construction of a new house of worship. Inaugurated on an unspecified date, the new synagogue was located at 7 Bahnhofstrasse. Huenfeld was home to a Jewish elementary school from 1888/89 until 1924, after which the teacher—he also served as chazzan and shochet—continued to instruct children in religion. Burials were conducted in Burghaun. In 1933, nine schoolchildren received religious instruction and two Jewish associations (one for men, the other for women) were active in the community. There were many acts of violence against Jews and Jewish-owned property in 1935; in April of that year, 20 local Jews were arrested. On Pogrom Night (November 9, 1938), rioters broke windows in the synagogue and in a neighboring Jewish house; in the early hours of November 10, the synagogue was set on fire. Five Jewish men were arrested on Pogrom Night, of whom three were sent to Buchenwald, where one died in December 1938. Several Jews moved to Huenfeld after 1933, 25 emigrated and 33 relocated within Germany. In 1941, eight Jews were arrested and sent to an unknown destination; in May 1942, two were deported to Majdanek; and in September 1942, the remaining 11 Jews were deported to Theresienstadt.

In 1902, in response to the fact that many Huerben Jews had moved to nearby Krumbach during the 1880s, the community was annexed to Krumbach. The Huerben rabbinate was eventually dissolved, after which the school limited its curriculum to religious instruction. In 1933, the community ran six Jewish associations, most of which were involved in charity work. In October 1937, the cemetery was desecrated (as it was on several occasions after the war). The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night. Jews were forced to load the Torah scrolls and ritual objects onto trucks, after which the items were destroyed. (Only one scroll survived.) In September 1939, the synagogue was converted into an army warehouse. Damaged by fire in November 1939, the building was demolished in 1940. Twenty-seven Huerben Jews emigrated and 18 relocated within Germany. In April 1942, 15 were deported to Piaski (via Munich). Huerben’s last Jew was deported to Theresienstadt in August 1942.

The Jewish cemetery was also “aryanized”; the bodies were exhumed and the site leveled. In the summer of 1941, Huerth’s remaining 11 Jews were forcibly moved into a “Jews’ House” on Olbruchstrasse; and in June and July of 1942, six of them were deported to Theresienstadt and five to the Minsk Ghetto. All perished. Three local Jews who were married to Christians survived the war in Huerth. In November 1991, a memorial plaque was erected on Weierstrasse.

It was during the early 19th century, too, that a Jewish school was opened in Huettenbach; there, Jewish pupils attended classes until 1921. The community maintained its own mikveh, but conducted burials in Schnaittach. In 1933, two children studied religion in Huettenbach. Later, on Pogrom Night, SA men broke into the synagogue, burned the Torah scrolls and ritual objects and set fire to the building, nearly burning it to the ground. The ruins were later demolished, and a garden was planted on the site. Two-thirds of the village’s Jews left before Pogrom Night. Twelve Jews still lived in Huettenbach on Pogrom Night, half of whom managed to escape that day. Approximately one week later, the municipal authorities confiscated the homes and properties of the few remaining Jews, after which (on November 28, 1938) they, too, fled. On November 29, an official ceremony was held to celebrate the village’s new “Jewfree” status. At least ten Huettenbach Jews died in the Shoah.

Most unusually, Ingenheim had a Jewish mayor, Bernard Roos, from 1860 until 1864. In 1933, four schoolchildren received religious instruction. Four Jewish associations and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active in the community, with which the Jews of Goecklingen, Heuchelheim and Klingenmuenster had been affiliated. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue and all its contents— including 20 Torah scrolls and numerous ritual objects— were burned. Most of the town’s remaining Jews left after the pogrom. The cemetery was desecrated in 1939. On October 22, 1940, Ingenheim’s remaining three Jews, all elderly women, were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least 30 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue’s ruins, damaged by artillery fire during the war, were eventually cleared, after which, in 1951, the plot was sold to a private buyer. A commemorative plaque was unveiled in Ingenheim in 1986.","Maren Cohen and Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, EJL, FJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=701,701
Ingolstadt,13th century,110 in 1925,100,"Although the history of Jewish Ingolstadt can be traced back to the 13th century, it was not until 1861 that Jews received official permission to settle there. In 1876, a Jewish banker established a prayer room in his home (at 9 Milchstrasse) and hired a teacher and a shochet, in effect establishing the foundation of the modern community. Local Jews established a prayer hall and a teacher’s apartment in 1890 (at 8 Milchstrasse), a cemetery in 1891 and a twostory synagogue (at 23 Theresienstrasse) in 1907. Several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in Ingolstadt in 1933. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, the synagogue’s windows, doors and furniture were destroyed; Torah scrolls, books, ritual objects and rugs were set on fire. Ingolstadt’s two remaining Jewish-owned businesses and the cemetery’s purification house were destroyed. During the Nazi period, 70 Ingolstadt Jews resettled elsewhere in Germany, 20 emigrated and ten died in Ingolstadt. The town’s remaining Jews left in early 1939, and we also know that at least 60 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1946, when Jewish refugees settled in Ingolstadt, the synagogue was reopened; and in 1952, by which point nearly all had left, the synagogue was once again shut down. A memorial plaque was later affixed to the building (now a private storehouse).","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=702,702
Insterburg,1834,363 in 1880,275,"The Jews of Insterburg (present-day Tschernjachowsk, Russia) inaugurated their first synagogue in 1865; by 1885, two Jewish cemeteries had been consecrated in the town. The Jewish community developed into the largest and most important Jewish community in East Prussia, the center of Jewish life in the region. Insterburg hosted a convention of Jewish community leaders in 1880, and the Association of East Prussian Communities (which helped needy immigrants) and many other Jewish organizations and associations were headquartered there. As was the case all over Germany, the Jewish population dwindled during the tumultuous 1930s. By 1938, over half of the Jewish population had left Insterburg. On Pogrom Night, the Nazis set the synagogue on fire and let it burn to the ground. In his memoirs, community member Josef Wilkowsky wrote that the ritual objects were burned with the building; twenty Torah scrolls, the Torah Ark, its beautiful curtain, and the library were all reduced to rubble and ash. In May 1939, 90 Jews lived in Insterburg.

Iserlohn,1230,300 in 1895,188,"Although records from 1230 mention a Jewish resident in Iserlohn, it was not until the 17th century that a Jewish community was established there. During the early 18th century, Lutherans often attacked local Jews at Easter time. Banned from trade and crafts, Iserlohn Jews earned a living through peddling, ritual slaughtering and moneylending. In 1790, Jewish children worked in local factories making buttons and needles. In Iserlohn, a Jewish cemetery was inaugurated in 1819. Later, in 1831, the community built a synagogue and school on Mendener Strasse. Local Jews became more prosperous in the late 19th century, specializing in the textile trade; Iserlohn was also home to Jewish industrialists, doctors, lawyers and teachers. Jewish commerce declined during the Nazi period, and the Jewish population dropped from 132 in 1936 to 87 in 1939. Earlier, in October of 1938, 12 Jews (four families) were expelled to Poland. In 1941/42, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into one house, after which they were deported to the East. Eighty-one Iserlohn Jews perished in the Shoah.

Ittlingen,mid-1600s,179 in 1858,40,"By 1858, the year in which this community recorded its peak membership figure, most local Jews earned a living as traders of cattle, leather, textiles, and grain. The community established a prayer room in the 17th century, a synagogue at Untere Muehlgasse in 1805, a mikveh on an unspecified date, a Jewish restaurant in 1887 and a cemetery on Richener Buehl in 1887. Local Jews were able to employ teachers of religion—who also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers—until 1925. In 1933, the diminished community (40 members) still brought in a teacher from nearby Bretten for the benefit of the few remaining schoolchildren. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior, ritual objects and furnishings were destroyed, as were other Jewish properties. The synagogue building was torn down later that month. Eleven Ittlingen Jews emigrated, 11 moved to other places in Germany, nine died in Ittlingen, and eight, the last, were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France, in October 1940. At least 16 Ittlingen Jews perished in the Shoah.

In 1867, the community, with which the Jews of Zippnow and Briesenitz were affiliated, replaced its 18thcentury synagogue with a new house of worship at 2 Kleine Strasse. Jastrow’s Jewish cemetery had been consecrated in the 18th century. Two hundred Jews lived in the village in 1932/33. Rabbi Dr. Rosenzweig served the community, as did a shochet and a teacher/chazzan, the latter of whom instructed 28 Jewish schoolchildren from Jastrow’s religious, primary and secondary schools. Active in the community were a chevra kadisha (founded in 1875), the Rausnitz Legat Foundation, a Jewish women’s association (1899) and a Jewish youth league. In 1938, the authorities “aryanized” the famous Simon Tobacco Factory, which had been founded by Hirsch Ephraim Simon in the early 19th century. That same year, on Pogrom Night (November 9-10, 1938), rioters destroyed the synagogue and damaged Jewish-owned stores; local Jewish men were arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where at least one of them died. In March 1940, Jastrow’s remaining Jews were sent to the Buergergarten camp, from which they were deported to the camps in Eastern Europe. At least 23 local Jews perished in the Shoah. As of this writing, the possible restoration of the Jewish cemetery—it was desecrated during the Nazi period—is now under consideration. In February 2011, representatives from a variety of organizations met in Jastrow to discuss the topic.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, KND, LJG, YV  www.deutsch-krone.com/jastrow2.htm  www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=706,706

The community, with which the Jews of Densberg were affiliated, maintained a mikveh and a cemetery, the latter of which was consecrated near Jesberg in or around 1900. Jesberg was home to a Jewish elementary school from 1838 until 1922, when the school limited its curriculum to religious studies only; Jakob Hoexter served as teacher from 1899 until 1924. In 1933, six schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. Two Jewish welfare associations—one for men, the other for women—were active in the community. In Jesberg, the anti-Jewish boycott began on March 11, 1933. Between 1933 and 1938, 27 local Jews emigrated from Germany; two families moved to Frankfurt. Jesberg’s synagogue was attacked on Pogrom Night. Several Jews left Jesberg after 1939, and we also know that at least 25 Jesberg Jews and five from Densberg were murdered in the Shoah.

Jessnitz/Mulde,1680,165 in 1835- 40,29,"The Jews of Jessnitz acquired properties for the establishment of a school and a synagogue in 1744 and 1796, respectively. In November 1865, the community inaugurated a new synagogue on Lange Strasse (present-day Martha-Brantszsch- Strasse). That same year, the cemetery on Strenggraben (present-day Schlossstrasse), which had been consecrated in 1680, was enlarged to include a purification house. The community also maintained two foundations for the sick and needy. Prominent local Jews included members of the Herz Family, whose textile business employed many. In 1933, the leader of the Jewish community was a Mr. Boschwitz. Six children received religious instruction that year. On Pogrom Night, SA and SS men in civilian clothing demolished Jewish properties and set fire to the synagogue. All Jewish residents were imprisoned in the police station, where they were held overnight; Fritz Hertz was sent to Buchenwald. The Nazis also ravaged the Jewish cemetery. The synagogue ruins were eventually cleared to make room for a new structure. The remaining Jews were forcibly moved into a “Jews’ house” after the pogrom. In November 1942, four Jewish women were deported to Theresienstadt; and in April of 1942 and March of 1943, seven were deported to the East. Hedwig Hammermann, who had been sent to Theresienstadt on August 6, 1940, survived her ordeal. At least 15 former residents of Jessnitz perished in the Shoah.

In 1779, the community established a prayer room and a cemetery, the latter of which was located on the road to Cleverns and enlarged in 1841. (Burials were conducted in Neustadtgoedens before 1841.) Built in 1801 on Wasserpfortstrasse, the synagogue was replaced by a larger building in 1880. Jever’s Jewish schoolteacher also served as shochet and chazzan. The Jews of Jever maintained a women’s organization, a charity, a choir, a literary circle and a branch of the Zionist movement. Jewish homes and businesses were looted on Pogrom Night, and 15 local Jews were deported to Sachsenhausen; Jever’s Jewish cemetery was vandalized, and the synagogue was set on fire, after which the building burned down completely. Later, in 1939, the synagogue’s ruins were sold to a contractor and demolished. Several Jews returned to Jever after the war, and we also know that the cemetery was restored. Until 1951, a nearby displaced persons camp housed approximately 1,500 Jewish survivors of Bergen-Belsen.

It was during the 19th century, however, that the community, with which the Jews of Mehlingen and Gunbach were affiliated, experienced substantial growth. Beginning in 1828, Kaiserslautern was home to a district rabbinate. The 19th-century community conducted services in prayer halls until 1849, when a synagogue was dedicated in the city. Later, in 1866, a new synagogue—with 400 seats for men and 200 for women—was established on Fruehlingsstrasse.

Karlsruhe,18th century,"3,386 in 1925","3,199","The town of Karlsruhe was founded in 1715, shortly after which Jews established a presence there. The city was the capital of the Baden region, therefore the Jewish community that developed there was the most important in the principality. In 1720, the community appointed a rabbi who served all of Baden; between 1750 and 1769, the post was filled by Rabbi Nathaniel Weil, a renowned Talmudic scholar. The rabbinate became a district rabbinate in 1827. By 1725, the Karlsruhe Jewish community had established a synagogue, a mikveh and a hospital. A new synagogue was built in 1806, but it was destroyed during the fire of 1871; accordingly, another house of worship was inaugurated at Kronenstrasse in 1875. Karlsruhe’s Orthodox Jews seceded from the community in 1868; in 1881, their congregation—the Adass Jeshurun—founded a synagogue, a community center and a mikveh at 16 Karl-Friedrich-Strasse. Eastern European Jews established the Ahavat Israel synagogue in 1929. Two Jewish elementary schools were opened in 1865: one for the mainstream community, the other for Orthodox Jews. The community consecrated a cemetery in 1723, another in 1816 and yet another, at Haid-und Neustrasse, on an unspecified date. Orthodox Jews consecrated their own cemetery in 1872. Prominent local Jews included the following: Moritz Ellstaetter, Baden’s finance minister from 1878 to 1893; and Ludwig Hass and Ludwig Marum, ministers in the first Republican Government of Baden. In 1933, Dr. Hugo Schiff was the rabbi of the mainstream community; Dr. Jakob Etlinger was rabbi of the Orthodox community. Many Jewish associations and branches of national organizations were active in Karlsruhe that year. The Bialik adult education institute, a local cultural association and an elementary school were active well into the Nazi period. In October 1938, Karlsruhe’s Polish Jews were expelled to Poland. The main synagogue was set on fire on Pogrom Night, but the blaze was extinguished to protect the neighboring houses; all 28 Torah scrolls were thrown out, and several were torn or burned. The Orthodox synagogue was burned to the ground, many homes and businesses were destroyed, and Jewish men were marched through town and abused by a mob of rioters. The men were tortured at police headquarters, where two died, after which most were sent to Dachau. In total, 893 local Jews were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. Between 1942 and 1945, 387 Karlsruhe Jews were deported to Izbica, to Auschwitz and to Theresienstadt. At least 1,421 local Jews perished in the Shoah. A new Jewish community, founded in 1945, inaugurated a synagogue on Herrenstrasse in 1951; and in 1971 another synagogue was inaugurated on Knielinger Allee. Several plaques commemorate the Jews of Karlsruhe.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, PK-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=721,721
Karbach,unknown,over 100 in the first half of the 1800s,45,"Forty-two Jews lived in Karbach in 1699, one of whom was a rabbi. The community peaked at more than 100 members during the first half of the 19th century, after which the village’s Jewish population began to dwindle. The community established a cemetery in 1819 and conducted services in a prayer hall until 1844, when a synagogue was built at 181 Marktplatz (later 1 Marktplatz). The synagogue building contained a classroom and, after 1826, a mikveh. Karbach Jews employed a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, the Loeb and Schifa Adler Foundation for Brides (established in 1890) was active in Karbach. One day before Pogrom Night, Jewish men were deported to Dachau, after which SS members from Marktheidenfeld and the surrounding area destroyed the synagogue’s interior. Assisted by boys from the Hitler Youth, SA men pillaged Jewish homes. During the Nazi period, five Karbach Jews emigrated and six relocated within Germany. The remaining 27 Jews were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in April 1942. At least 47 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was later converted into a town hall; a commemorative plaque was unveiled there in 2002. Since 2006 the preserved mikveh has been used for educational purposes. The Jewish cemetery houses a memorial.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=720,720
Karlstadt,13th century,72 in 1910,35,"The earliest known record of Jews in Karlstadt mentions them in connection with the Rindfleisch riots of 1298. The town’s modern Jewish community was founded in the late 19th century. Karlstadt was home to a Jewish cemetery from the years 1440 to 1563. During the 19th and 20th centuries, local Jews conducted services in a rented hall and buried their dead in Laudenbach. By May 1938, the community could no longer gather a minyan; accordingly, the community joined that of neighboring Laudenbach for religious services. On Pogrom Night, SA, SS, Hitler Youth and a considerable number of local residents (including children) assaulted Karlstadt’s remaining Jews, broke into the prayer hall, destroyed ritual objects and vandalized the interior. The rioters also forced their way into Jewish homes and wrecked everything inside: books, clothes and merchandise were piled up in the marketplace—some were stolen, others confiscated by Nazi organizations, and still others were burned. During the Nazi period, 20 Karlstadt Jews emigrated, three relocated within Germany, eight left for unknown destinations and four died in Karlstadt. By 1940, only two Jewish women remained, both of whom were married to Christians. At least seven local Jews perished in the Shoah.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=722,722
Kastellaun,14th century,64 in 1895,see below,"Jews were expelled from Kastellaun in the 1380s, and although we do not know when, exactly, another Jewish presence was established there, records point to 1862 as the year in which the modern community began to emerge. The official Jewish community of Kastellaun was founded in 1899. Local Jews established the following communal institutions: a Jewish cemetery (1879); a prayer room (1891); a school for religious studies (founded on an unspecified date); and, finally, a synagogue on Eifelstrasse (1892). Although 85 Jews lived in Kastellaun at the beginning of 1933, that number had dropped to 66 by June of that year. A teacher from Hasenthal instructed 11 children in religion, and the community maintained a Jewish women’s association and a welfare society. Surprisingly, a Jew was elected to the local council in 1933. On Pogrom Night, rioters demolished the Kastellaun synagogue; several Jewish men were sent to Dachau. In 1942, after the synagogue ruins had been cleared, the town council appropriated the synagogue site. Approximately 20 local Jews managed to immigrate to the United States. Nine Jews, the town’s last, were deported to Auschwitz in April and August of 1942. At least 20 Kastellaun Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial stone was unveiled at the Jewish cemetery in 1986.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=724,724
Kassel,1262,"3,000 in 1875","2,301","Records from 1262 mention a Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”). The medieval Jewish community was destroyed in the Black Death pogroms (1348/49), and although individual Jews lived there during the ensuing centuries, it was not until the 17th century that an actual community was established in Kassel. Records from 1398 mention a synagogue (on the Judengasse), and we also know that a cemetery was located nearby. Three more cemeteries were consecrated in Kassel: in 1385, in 1630 (enlarged in 1841) and in 1932. During the 17th century, Jews were forbidden to conduct services outside a designated Jewish-owned house. Synagogues were opened in Kassel in 1716 and 1755, and in 1839 the community inaugurated a synagogue on 34 Untere Koenigstrasse; between 1904 and 1907, the building was enlarged to accommodate 390 seats for men and 340 for women. The community also maintained a mikveh and a Jewish school; the latter was opened in 1800, closed for unspecified reasons, and, in 1824, reopened. In 1860, Orthodox Jews started conducting separate services. They formed their own congregation in 1876 (without separating from the mainstream community) and, in 1898, inaugurated a synagogue—85 seats for men—in the Jewish community center at 22 Grosse Rosenstrasse (renovated in 1927). Eastern European Jews inaugurated their own synagogue on the corner of Bremerstrasse and Koenigstrasse. In 1933, 2,301 Jews lived in Kassel. Many Jewish associations, branches of nation-wide organizations, funds and institutions (including an orphanage and an old-age home) were active in the community. One hundred and seventy-six children attended the Jewish school. Franz Rosenzweig, the renowned philosopher, was a descendant of Kassel Jews. Baron Paul Julius von Reuter, founder of the Reuters news agency, was the son of a Kassel rabbi. Attacks on Jews and Jewish-owned properties accelerated after the Nazis’ election victories. In March 1933, a Jewish lawyer was beaten to death by SA men. Roland Freisler, the notorious Nazi judge and President of the People’s Court in Berlin, started his career as a local Nazi leader in Kassel. On November 7, 1938, two days before Pogrom Night, Nazis set fire to the mainstream community’s synagogue (firemen extinguished the blaze), damaged the community center and school, destroyed Jewishowned businesses and assaulted Jews. On Pogrom Night, the interiors of the mainstream and Orthodox synagogues were set on fire; Torah scrolls and ritual objects were desecrated, burned or plundered. The community center and offices were destroyed, and 300 men were sent to Buchenwald. Hundreds of Jewish businesses and homes were ravaged that night. A few weeks later, the main synagogue was demolished to make room for a parking lot. In 1940, the remaining 1,300 Jews were moved into “Jews’ houses” from which they were taken for forced labor and, between 1941 and 1945, deported to the East. At least 1,007 Kassel Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial plaque was later unveiled at the former synagogue site; the new Jewish cemetery houses several memorial monuments. A new Jewish community was founded in Kassel in 1945. In 1965, a synagogue and community center were built on Bremer Strasse. A larger synagogue and community center were built on the same site in 2000. In 2003, the cemetery was heavily desecrated.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: ADL, AJ, EJL, JVL PK-HNF  www.uni-kassel.de  denksteinsammlung.html < www.holocaustresearchproject.org",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=723,723

The community established a cemetery (in use until 1942) and a Jewish private school in 1810 and 1826, respectively. According to records, the old synagogue on Judenstrasse (“Jews’ street”) was later replaced by a new building on Umstrasse. Although several local Jewish families were able to flee Germany after 1933, most were still living there on Pogrom Night (November 1938), when they helplessly watched the SS burn down the synagogue. After the war, three of the culprits were sentenced to prison terms. At least 35 Kempen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Kehl am Rhein,unknown,156 in 1905,109,"This Jewish community was established in 1881. Services were conducted in a private residence, where a prayer hall had been set up, until 1889, when local Jews inaugurated their first synagogue. In 1924, prior to which burials had been conducted in Freistett, the community consecrated a cemetery in a section of the municipal burial grounds. A women’s association and a welfare organization for migrants were active in Kehl in 1933. The teacher instructed 18 Jewish children that year. In October 1938, a Jewish family was deported to Poland. One month later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue interior was damaged and its ritual objects destroyed. Jewish men were imprisoned in the town hall together with Jews from the surrounding communities; they were brutally whipped by SS men, forced to torture each other, marched through the town and, finally, sent to Dachau. The synagogue was demolished later that year. Fifty-seven Kehl Jews fled the country, 39 relocated within Germany, seven died in Kehl and 22 were deported to Gurs in October, 1940. Two Jewish women avoided this transport, but were deported to the East in 1941/42. At least 55 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1983, a plaque was unveiled at the synagogue site; in 1991, a stone pillar was erected next to the old town hall as a reminder of the brutalities committed there on Pogrom Night.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL, HU, PK-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=725,725
Kempten,1373,91 in 1910,50,"The modern Jewish community of Kempten was founded in the 1870s, at which point it established a prayer room and a cemetery. In 1933, five Jewish children studied religion in Kempten. Riots did not break out in the town on Pogrom Night (November 9-10, 1938), but several Jews were arrested and placed in “protective” custody. On November 11, Jewishowned shops were closed down and the homes of Jewish residents were searched. Beginning in 1942, Kempten’s remaining Jews were housed in a building referred to as the Judenhaus (“Jews’ house). In February 1942, a Jewish man was arrested for criticizing the Nazi government; he was handed over to the Munich Gestapo, but his fate is unknown. Between 1933 and 1940, 14 Kempten Jews emigrated, 12 relocated within Germany and three died in Kempten. Ten were deported to Piaski (via Munich) in March 1942; another four were deported to Theresienstadt in August 1942; and three Kempten Jews, all of whom were married to Christians, were deported to Theresienstadt in February 1945. At least 30 Kempten Jews perished in the Shoah. The community’s prayer room (33, Residenzplatz), ritual objects and cemetery survived the pogrom. Two memorials were later erected at the cemetery to commemorate Kempten’s murdered Jews and the inmates of a nearby concentration camp.","Magret Liat Wolf  Sources: AJ, GKJS, LJS, PK-BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=727,727

The community, however, was destroyed in the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. In or around 1720, several Jews established themselves in the town as traders, brewers and moneylenders. The community opened a cemetery and a synagogue in 1823 and 1830, respectively. Kerpen was also home to a Jewish school between 1823 and approximately 1939; there, the average enrollment was between 10 and 20 pupils per year. Many Jews left Kerpen after the Nazis’ election victories. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was vandalized, as were the remaining Jewish homes. In 1941/42, the remaining 35 Jews were deported to the camps, from which they did not return. The synagogue, which had been forcibly sold to the municipality at a bargain price, was used as a warehouse and later converted into a residence.

Most emigrated soon after 1933, and by 1936 the community had been dissolved. In 1839, the community built a synagogue with a seating capacity of 60. Although the Jewish school (unknown date of construction) had been closed in 1900, the community continued to provide children with religious instruction; according to records, four children studied religion in 1923. We also know that Kestrich’s Jewish cemetery had been consecrated soon after the first Jews settled in the town. Even though the Jewish community was no longer functioning by then, its synagogue was demolished on Pogrom Night, and the remaining three Jews were deported to Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 10 Kestrich Jews perished in the Shoah. The destroyed synagogue building was later rebuilt and, in July 2005, opened to the public as a museum and memorial site.

In 1824, a synagogue was established in a private residence on Hockenheimer Strasse. The community was always small—the synagogue took up only one-fourth of the house—and never maintained any organizations or hired a teacher. Local Jews conducted burials in Wiesloch. In 1932, the community’s only schoolchild studied religion in Schwetzingen. Jews from nearby Bruehl were members of the Ketsch community. Three Jews emigrated from Ketsch; nine relocated within Germany (nearly all of them before 1938). Although the community was dissolved in October 1937, the synagogue’s furniture and ritual objects were nevertheless damaged on Pogrom Night. The structure was also damaged, as were the few remaining Jewish properties. A local Jew was sent to Dachau, where he died in January 1939. In December 1938, the two remaining Jews left Ketsch. We also know that the Jewish council of Baden sold its section of the synagogue building in 1939, after which (on an unspecified date) the structure was pulled down.

At some point after 1776, local Jews began to conduct prayer services in a small building; purchased by the community in 1835, the synagogue building—it also housed a mikveh and a schoolroom—was enlarged to include a women’s gallery. An elementary school was opened there in 1871, but it was moved to the adjoining building in 1883, where it remained until 1914. The interior of the synagogue was plundered on Pogrom Night and partly destroyed during the following weeks. A commemorative plaque was later unveiled at the site.

Kiel,17th century,,,"The earliest available records of a Jewish presence in Kiel are from the 17th century, when “court Jews” settled there. It was not, however, until the 19th century that the Jewish population experienced considerable growth. Synagogues were inaugurated on Kehdenstrasse and Hassstrasse in, respectively, 1782 and 1869, the latter synagogue gave way to a new house of worship, on Goethestrasse/ Humboldtstrasse—the building accommodated 650 seats and a Jewish school—in 1910. Kiel’s Jewish cemetery on Michelsenstrasse (still in use) was consecrated in 1852. Many Eastern European Jews moved to Kiel’s Gaengerviertel neighborhood after 1918. In 1933, Kiel was home to 613 Jews; 80 children received religious instruction from a teacher/chazzan. Active in the community were a Jewish women’s association (established in 1892) and two other foundations, all of which conducted welfare work, as well as seven local branches of national Jewish organizations. The community maintained a mikveh and a library that year. Kiel’s rabbi emigrated in the summer of 1933, the same year in which two Jewish lawyers were murdered and Jewish university instructors were dismissed from their posts. The bravery with which local non-Jewish residents defied the anti-Jewish boycott (initiated in April 1933) resulted in its lack of success in Kiel. In 1938, as a result of the Nazis’ racial laws, local Jews opened a public school. Polish Jews returned to Kiel shortly after their deportation in October 1938. On Pogrom Night, members of the SA, SS and Nazi Party damaged the synagogue’s interior and set parts of it on fire. Jewish property was destroyed that night, and approximately 55 Jewish men were arrested, of whom 10 were sent to Sachsenhausen. Later, in 1939/40, the synagogue was torn down. In 1939, local Jews were moved into “Jews’ houses.” Most emigrated or moved to other German cities, 12 committed suicide and approximately 50 were deported to Riga in 1941. At least 240 Kiel Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1967/68, an apartment building was erected on the synagogue site (on Goethestrasse).

Kirf,early 19th century,117 in 1905 (18% of the total population),78,"The Jews of Kirf were members of Freudenburg’s Jewish community until the mid-19th century. The Kirf Jews inaugurated a synagogue during the latter half of that century, prior to which they had attended the services in Freudenburg. (In 1824, the authorities had turned down a request to build a synagogue in Kirf.) Beginning, at the latest, in 1885, local Jews hired teachers of religion who also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers. Records from 1909 mention a private Jewish elementary school (28 pupils), but it was, apparently, no longer functioning by 1913. We also know that, in 1925, a teacher of Freudenburg instructed the community’s schoolage children in religion. It was not until 1932 that a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Kirf. Seventy-eight Jews lived in Kirf in 1933. A welfare association was active in the community that year. In the years 1934 to 1936, anti-Semitic thugs often smashed windows in Jewish homes and in the synagogue. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was destroyed. Thirty Kirf Jews managed to emigrate; another 44 relocated to other towns and cities in Germany. When World War II broke out in September 1939, all of Kirf ’s inhabitants, including the remaining Jews, were evacuated to central Germany. At least 27 Kirf Jews perished in the Shoah. The Jewish cemetery was desecrated during the Nazi period. According to records, the synagogue building was sold after the war.","Rachel Borut  Sources: EJL, FJG, ZG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=739,739
Kirn,13th century,109 in 1905,78,"Jews left Kirn after anti-Jewish riots erupted there in 1287. Another Jewish presence was established in the town in the 1830s, but it was not until 1924, some 54 years after it began to develop, that a Jewish community was officially founded. The 19th-century community temporarily conducted services in a rented gymnasium; in 1888, a synagogue was inaugurated on Amtshofstrasse. Records tell us that Kirn was home to a regional Jewish cemetery in the early 18th century, but we do not know when it was consecrated. We know for certain, however, that the community consecrated its own cemetery in 1867. Jewish children studied religion with a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Fourteen schoolchildren received religious instruction in 1933, and several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide Jewish organizations were active in the community, with which the Jews of Becherbach were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, SA men smashed the synagogue’s windows and furniture; the homes of 12 Jewish families were destroyed. During the Nazi period, 27 Kirn Jews emigrated, 38 relocated within Germany, one died in Kirn and eleven were deported to the East, via Kreuznach, in July 1942. Later, in 1944, a local Jew—he or she was, presumably, married to a Christian—was deported to Sachsenhausen. At least 28 local Jews perished in the Shoah. Kirn’s Jewish cemetery was desecrated during the war and in again 1979. The synagogue building was demolished in 1950, after which a movie theater was built on the site.

Kirtorf,1661,64 in 1895,approximately 35,"In 1696, local residents complained that noise from the Jewish prayer hall (it was located in a private residence) disturbed services at the nearby church, as did the singing from the annual Sukkot celebrations. The 18th-century Jewish community conducted services in another home. Another fact the records tell us is that the curtain for the Torah Ark was repaired in 1811. Jewish householders engaged in various occupations, mostly cattle and horse trading as well as light farming on the land attached to their homes. Although a house was purchased in 1843 and rebuilt as a synagogue with classrooms and a mikveh, the structure proved to be faulty and was sold at a loss. In 1852, the community purchased another house and rebuilt it to accommodate all these facilities; and in 1901, the community finally built a purpose-built synagogue. Kirtorf was also home to a Jewish school, established there during the early days of the community, whose teacher served as chazzan and shochet. When enrollment numbers dwindled, the teacher supplemented his meager income by instructing children from the adjoining communities. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 triggered a wave of emigration. Accordingly, few Jews witnessed the unfolding of Pogrom Night in Kirtorf, when rioters vandalized the synagogue and burned ritual objects in the market square. The remaining 10 Jews were deported in 1942. In 1983, a memorial plaque was unveiled in Kirtorf. Remnants of the synagogue can still be discerned.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: AJ, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=741,741
Kitzingen,1147,478 in 1910,360,"The first available record of a Jewish presence in Kitzingen is dated 1147. Rabbis officiated there during the Middle Ages, and a synagogue was documented in the 16th century. Kitzingen Jews, often persecuted in pogroms, were expelled from the town in 1789, and it was not until 1863 that a new Jewish presence was established there. In 1865, these Jews founded a community; and in 1871, Kitzingen became the seat of a district rabbinate. Jews conducted services in prayer halls until 1833, when a synagogue was dedicated on Landwehrstrasse. The modern community renovated its mikveh and synagogue in 1901 and again in 1908, and we also know that it established a Jewish elementary school in 1914. Burials were conducted in Roedelsee. In 1933, 360 Jews lived in Kitzingen; Dr. Joseph Wohlgemuth was rabbi. Twenty-four pupils attended the elementary school, 62 children studied religion and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations were active in the town. The community’s teacher also performed the duties of chazzan; the shochet was the synagogue caretaker. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and partly burned the building, after which the Torah scrolls were set on fire; Jewish homes and businesses were vandalized and plundered by hammer-wielding rioters. All Jewish men were arrested: the sick and disabled were released, but the others were imprisoned in Wuerzburg. Of these, several were released (one died of a heart attack upon seeing his destroyed house and wine shop), and 23 were deported to Dachau. During the Nazi period, 192 Kitzingen Jews emigrated and 111 relocated within Germany. In 1942, the remaining Jews were forced to move into one building: 99 were deported to Izbica and to Theresienstadt (the deportations began in April 1942). At least 157 Kitzingen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1966, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the synagogue site; and in 1993, the renovated building reopened as a cultural center.","Magret Liat Wolf  Sources: AJ, PK BAV  www.kitzingen.info/stadt/altesynagoge/  www.bauforschung-wieser.de/KITZINGEN-SYNAGOGE.pdf",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=742,742

The cemetery, the second largest in Bavaria, served 27 neighboring communities and was enlarged in 1769 and again in 1843. By 1837, the community had established a mikveh, a school and a synagogue, the last two of which were located at 12 Obere Hauptstrasse. Opened in 1812, the school was presided over by a teacher who served as chazzan and shochet. We also know that, in 1896, the community built a new synagogue at 5 Untere Hauptstrasse. The synagogue on Obere Hauptstrasse was sold and demolished in 1913, around which time, in response to the fact that large numbers of Jews were leaving Kleinbardorf, the community merged with that of Kleineibstadt. Although the synagogue had been sold in 1937, it was damaged on Pogrom Night, when Nazis from Koenigshofen vandalized the building and destroyed the interior. Eight Jews lived in Kleinbardorf in July 1938, three of whom eventually emigrated. Five local Jews were deported: three to Izbica (in the Lublin district, Poland) and two, an elderly couple, to Theresienstadt. At least 29 Kleinbardorf Jews perished in the Shoah. The cemetery—it was desecrated in 1925, in the 1930s, in 1957 and in 1977—houses a memorial plaque.

Beginning in 1831, the community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of shochet and chazzan. We also know that the school closed down in 1922. In 1933, 36 Jews lived in Kleinheubach; eleven Jews from neighboring Grossheubach were affiliated with the community. The mikveh, no longer in use after 1926, was sold in 1935. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects were destroyed, after which the building was sold to a private individual. During the Nazi period, 14 Kleinheubach Jews emigrated and 11 relocated within Germany. Two were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in April 1942, as was Grossheubach’s last Jewish family.

The synagogue housed a classroom and an apartment for a teacher, and we also know that one of the castle’s fountains was converted into a mikveh. Burials were conducted in Boedigheim. In 1933, 28 Jews lived in Kleineicholzheim; two children studied religion with a teacher from Grosseicholzheim. Two Jews moved to Kleineicholzheim after 1933, and a baby was born there. On Pogrom Night, non-local SA men destroyed the synagogue’s interior. Jewish homes and properties were also damaged, and the two remaining Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Fourteen Kleineicholzheim Jews immigrated to the United States, two died in Kleineicholzheim and 15, the last, were deported to Gurs in October 1940. At least 12 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

The community maintained a Jewish school and, after 1872, a cemetery near Edisonstrasse. In 1933, 30 Jews still lived in Klein-Krotzenburg; a Jewish family of four in nearby Hainstadt was affiliated with the community. The cigarette factory was “aryanized” in 1934, after which its owner, Max Rosenthal, moved to Karlsruhe with his family. The synagogue interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night. Jewish homes were plundered, and Jewish men were humiliated in the schoolyard before being sent to Dachau. The former synagogue, subsequently appropriated by the village authorities, was later used as a workshop and storage site. Fourteen Jews emigrated; the others relocated in Germany. By the end of 1939, all Jews had left Klein-Krotzenburg and Hainstadt. At least 17 Klein-Krotzenburg Jews died in the Shoah.

The Jewish community established a prayer room in 1680 and a synagogue on Schnuerlingsdamm (later Synagogenstrasse, or “synagogue street”) in 1756. The synagogue was destroyed in a neighborhood fire in 1811, after which, in 1815, it was rebuilt. Eastern European Jews operated three prayer rooms. In 1896, liberal Jews in Koenigsberg inaugurated a synagogue, called the “New Synagogue,” on Lindenstrasse. The Orthodox Adass Jisroel congregation, which had begun conducting its prayer services at the old synagogue in 1893, maintained its own school for religious studies, mikveh and slaughterhouse. The community consecrated its first cemetery, on Wrangelstrasse, in 1703/04. Additional burial grounds were consecrated in 1875 and in 1929. Jews contributed greatly to the city’s social, political and cultural life. After World War I, however, as anti- Semitic parties gained a foothold in Koenigsberg, local Jews were assaulted, their institutions attacked and their businesses boycotted. In 1932, SA members destroyed Jewish-owned properties. In June, 1933, 3,170 Jews lived in Koenigsberg; 457 children received religious instruction, and 36 students attended a Hebrew school on Lindenstrasse. Active in the community were 14 welfare associations, several social work foundations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations. We also know that the community maintained a library and published a journal. In March 1933, the old synagogue and Jewish-owned stores were set on fire; a local Jew was murdered by SA men. Jewish social life continued to flourish, however, and a Jewish school was founded in 1935. On Pogrom Night, Nazis burned down the New Synagogue and destroyed Jewish institutions and prayer rooms. The following morning, Jewish-owned stores and homes were looted, a cemetery was damaged and 400 men were imprisoned in Methgethen. Beginning in 1939, Koenigsberg’s remaining Jews were confined to designated “Jews’ houses” and subjected to forced labor. Approximately 1,100 local Jews were deported to Minsk, Riga and Theresienstadt in 1942/43. In 1943, Polish Jews from Stutthof and Soldau were brought to Koenigsberg as forced laborers. In January 1945, approximately 7,000 Jews were marched from Koenigsberg to Palmnicken. Today, nearly 2,000 Jews live in Koenigsberg. In October 2011, the new community laid the foundation stone of a synagogue on Lindenstrasse (present-day Oktyabrskaya Street). A plaque was affixed to the former Jewish orphanage in 2006.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AH, EJL, FJG, LJG, W-E, W-G  kaliningrad-eu.blogspot.com/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=756,756
Koenigsfeld,1599 (see below),22 in 1871,14,"Although Jews were granted permission to settle in Koenigsfeld in 1336, the earliest record of a Jewish presence there is dated 1599. Local Jews were initially members of the Niederzissen community. The tiny Koenigsfeld community established a cemetery in 1838 and a synagogue in the 1840s, which was located on the upper floor of Bermann Gottschalk’s house on Hauptstrasse. Jewish schoolchildren from Koenigsfeld, Dedenbach and Schalkenbach studied religion—usually under the guidance of a teacher from Niederzissen—in the synagogue building. The Koenigsfeld community also maintained a mikveh. We also know that in 1847, the Jews of Koenigsfeld, Dedenbach and Schalkenbach formed one Jewish community. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue, which was then owned by Mathilde Gottschalk, was attacked. After destroying the synagogue’s interior and windows, SA men publicly burned the Torah scrolls, ritual objects and broken furniture in the village square. Mathilde Gottschalk sold the building in 1939, after which it was used for various purposes. At least nine Jews from Koenigsfeld and five from Dedenbach perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was demolished in 1965, and a new building was built on the site. At some point during the 1960s, a section of the Jewish cemetery was fenced off and restored. The random way in which the 21 surviving headstones are arranged suggests that they were not placed on the matching graves. A commemorative plaque has been affixed to a former Jewish home at 1 Krumme Gasse.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=757,757
Koenigstein,13th century,76 in 1925,"73 - Koenigstein, 20 - Kronberg and 15 - Falkenst.","By 1807, the Jews of Koenigstein, Kronberg and Falkenstein had formed a joint community. The Kronberg community was dissolved in 1908, after which Koenigstein became the community’s headquarters. Kronberg’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1709, Falkenstein’s in the early 19th century. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, Jews in Koenigstein attended synagogue services in Kronberg and Falkenstein. In or around 1848, a prayer room—it housed a mikveh— was established in Koenigstein on Rentgasse (present-day Gerichtsstrasse). In 1906 the prayer room was replaced by a synagogue and mikveh at 9 Seilerbahnweg; the synagogue seated 72 men and 34 women. Falkenstein’s synagogue was sold at some point after 1906, Kronberg’s in 1911. In 1934, local police ordered that the Kronberg cemetery be cleared. The Koenigstein synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. Jewish homes were damaged, six men were sent to a concentration camp and a Jewish writer from Kronberg committed suicide in Gestapo headquarters in Frankfurt. The synagogue ruins were demolished in 1939. Eighteen Koenigstein Jews and six from Kronberg were deported in 1942. A Jewish woman from Kronberg who was married to a Christian was deported to Auschwitz in 1944. At least 32 Koenigstein Jews and eight from Kronberg perished in the Shoah. A residential building, to which a memorial plaque was affixed in 1978, was erected on the synagogue site; in 1997, a bronze model of the synagogue was unveiled in a public park.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL, PK-HNF  www.koenigstein.de  www.villa-rothschild.com",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=758,758
Koethen,14th century,350 in 1875,156,"Official documents from 1620 mention five Jewish families in Koethen, after which, during the reign of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Koethen, more Jews received letter of protection. Koethen was home to several important Hebrew printing houses from 1622 until 1717. Prior to 1777, the year in which the Jewish community was officially established, Jews conducted services in a prayer room on Schalaunische Strasse; that same year, a small cemetery was consecrated on Am Welschen Busch. Records suggest that Koethen was home to a mikveh after the beginning of the 18th century. In 1802, the community, of which Jews from several neighboring towns, for example, Guesten, Nienburg and Woerbzig, were members, inaugurated a synagogue at 5 Burgstrasse; next to the synagogue were classrooms and a teacher’s residence. Later, in 1891 (after the community had grown to 250 members), the Burgstrasse synagogue was demolished and replaced with a domed synagogue whose architectural style incorporated both Romanesque and Moorish features. The new Jewish cemetery on Maxdorfer Strasse was consecrated in 1888. Over 30% of the town’s Jews either emigrated from Germany or moved to larger cities after the Nazis rose to power. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was looted, desecrated and set on fire; both cemeteries were destroyed, but the cemetery hall remained undamaged. Many local Jews were deported to the East; the remaining Jews, most of whom were elderly, were deported to Theresienstadt. At least 80 Koethen Jews perished in the Shoah. The cemetery on Maxdorfer Strasse, which housed approximately 150 tombstones, was restored after the war. In 1962, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site; the plaque was desecrated in the 1990s, and later disappeared. Jewish inventor Rudolph Herzberg, who came up with the main concept of the mechanical sewing machine, was born in Koethen in 1837.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: AJ, EJ, EJL, JL, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=760,760
Koeslin,1700,361 in 1880,140,"The history of Jewish Koeslin (present-day Koszalin, Poland) began in 1705, when Borchard Philip and his extended family settled in Pomerania. Philip, a rich merchant who provided local cloth manufacturers with wool and money, eventually opened his own textile factory, employing 100 workers. During the 18th century, Koeslin Jews attended services in the Neustettiner synagogue. Later, on an unspecified date in the 19th century, the growing community consecrated a prayer hall on Hohetorstrasse, which they used until a domed synagogue was built on Am Wall in 1885. Unable to employ a permanent rabbi—Rabbi Heymann Jolowitz served for a brief period during the mid-19th century—the congregation instead employed a teacher of religion and Hebrew who also performed the duties of cantor and sermonizer. We do not know when the community consecrated its cemetery on Badegasse (near Muehlenbach), but records do tell us that in 1900, a new cemetery, morgue and guardhouse were built on Schwarzen Berg. Jewish-owned businesses, for example, a paper factory, a brewery and a bank, contributed to the economic development of the city. Many young Jews, however, left Koeslin in the late 19th century, when anti-Semitic riots swept Pomerania. Later, soon after Germany’s defeat in World War I, community membership dwindled further. During Pogrom Night, on November 10, 1938, the synagogue and morgue were set on fire, gravestones were desecrated and Jewish-owned stores were vandalized. Several Koeslin Jews tried to immigrate to Shanghai during the Nazi period, but it is unclear whether or not they reached their destination. In 1942, all Jews under the age of 65 were detained in a local sports hall and deported to Auschwitz; six weeks later, the remaining Jews were deported to Theresienstadt. The Polish authorities later cleared the cemetery’s ruins, after which a residential building was built on the site.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: LJG, FJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=759,759
Kolberg,1261,600 in 1883,200,"Kolberg (present-day Kolobrzeg, Poland) was probably home to the first Jewish settlement in Pomerania. Although town records from the mid-15th century mention a Judenstrat (“Jews’ street”) Jews were prohibited from settling in Kolberg throughout the following three centuries. It was not until the first half of the 19th century that this ban was rescinded, after which the community grew rapidly. The cemetery dates back to 1815/20, and we also know that the synagogue was inaugurated in 1845, one year after its foundations were laid. Salomon Goldschmidt, the community’s second rabbi, served from the 1860s until 1925; he was not, however, the only rabbi to serve the community during this 60-year period. Rabbi Goldschmidt contributed to the establishment, in 1874, of a convalescent home with mineral baths. The home, which was privately funded, took in many needy Jews free of charge. A memorial was unveiled in honor of one of the founders, physician Dr. Hermann Hirschfeld. Not surprisingly, the town gained a reputation as a health resort. Another prominent Kolberg Jew was Magnus Hirschfeld, a pioneer in the field of sexology: in 1908, he founded the first German journal on the subject; in 1918, he established the Institute for Sexology in Berlin. Hirschfeld left for France in 1933 and died in Nice. In 1919, anti-Semitic posters started appearing in spas; accordingly, Jewish guests suffered frequent mistreatment. Later, the Nazi authorities banned Jews from parts of the beach and urged convalescent homes to reject Jews. The dire political and economic circumstances forced the Jewish congregation to abandon the cemetery. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue and Jewish-owned stores were vandalized and destroyed. The hospital was shut down after several violent attacks and converted into a storage facility for coal. In 1940, many Kolberg Jews were deported, together with Jews from Stettin, to Lublin, from where they were forced to march further east. One hundred and forty local Jews perished in the Shoah. A Star of David, embedded in the pavement at the former synagogue site, commemorates Kolberg’s Jewish community.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, FJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=761,761
Konstanz,,565 in 1900,443,"It was not until 1849 that the ban on Jewish settlement in the town of Konstanz was rescinded. A Jewish community was organized in 1863, but was affiliated with Tingen until 1897, when the independent Jewish community of Konstanz was founded. Local Jews established a series of prayer rooms after 1864; a cemetery in 1869; a synagogue, at 19 Sigismundstrasse, in 1883; and a community center with a library and a kosher restaurant in 1897, the same year in which the community hired a rabbi. Konstanz hosted a district rabbinate after 1925. In 1933, many Jewish associations and branches of national Jewish organizations were active in Konstanz; 68 Jewish children studied religion that year. Although the synagogue was set on fire in 1936, it was renovated in 1937. In 1938, in response to the expulsion of Jewish children from public schools, a Jewish school was opened in Konstanz. Local Polish Jews were deported to Poland in October 1938. The synagogue was blown up with dynamite on Pogrom Night. Ritual objects and books from the community center were confiscated, and Jewish men (and several women) were arrested, some of whom were brutally beaten and sent to Dachau, where one died. Three hundred and forty-four Jews moved to Konstanz during the Nazi period, 338 emigrated, 251 relocated within Germany and 60 died in Konstanz. On October 22, 1940, 110 Jews were deported to Gurs; six were deported to the East in April 1942. At least 102 local Jews perished in the Shoah. Several survivors returned to Konstanz in 1945. A new building had been built on the former synagogue site, and it was there that these Jews established a prayer room. The new Jewish community of Konstanz, founded in 1988, hired a rabbi in 2005. A plaque and a memorial stone have been unveiled at the synagogue site and at the cemetery, respectively.

Community membership peaked at 69 in 1925. Jews attended the Koenen synagogue until 1886, when the independent Konz community inaugurated a synagogue at 5 Lindenstrasse. The Konz Jews also maintained a school for religious studies and a Jewish cemetery, the latter of which was consecrated inside the municipal graveyard at some point during the 19th century. In 1933, 61 Jews lived in Konz; by 1938, however, that number had dropped to 25. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters destroyed the interior of the Konz synagogue. At least 26 Jews from Konz perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue was purchased by a private buyer in 1957, after which it was remodeled as a residential building.

Korbach,15th century,151 in 1880,133,"Although Jews lived in Korbach (Corbach) as early as the 15th century, it was not until 1760 that a functioning Jewish community was established there. That community belonged to the district rabbinate in Kassel. Local Jews initially conducted services in a private home. Some sort of prayer hall or room existed in the town by 1892, and in 1895 the community inaugurated a new synagogue with a seating capacity of 130, an organ, and an elevated section for a 16-member choir. The Korbach community, which eventually aligned itself with Reform Judaism, maintained a mikveh, a Jewish elementary school (1890-1900), a school for religious studies, and a cemetery (1774-1935). The cemetery, located near the Henxengarten, contains 114 extant stones; headstones could not be purchased for those Jews who passed away in Korbach in the years 1938 to 1940. Beginning in the late 18th century, the community employed a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Moritz Goldwein, the community’s last schoolteacher, took up this post in 1927; he moved to Kassel on an unspecified date, and was deported from there, together with his wife, in 1942. In 1932, the leaders of the community were Edmund Mosheim and Siegmund Stahl. Seventeen children studied religion with Moritz Goldwein. The synagogue, school and community center were destroyed on Pogrom Night; the synagogue was set on fire, but the blaze was extinguished to prevent damage to neighboring homes. Thirty-nine Jews lived in Korbach in 1939. Deportations took place in September 1941 and in 1942. At least 58 Korbach Jews, one from Berndorf and four from Goddelsheim (affiliated Jewish communities) were murdered in the Shoah. In 1947, a memorial stone was unveiled at the Jewish cemetery; and in 1996, another memorial was unveiled in Korbach.

Korschenbroich,1689,67 in 1885,unknown (20 in 1932),"Religious services were conducted in Joseph Wallach’s home on Muhlenstrasse until 1826, when the Jewish inhabitants of Korschenbroich built a small synagogue on the same street. Towards the end of the century, the community purchased an adjacent house and established there a school for religious studies, a communal office and living accommodation for a community official and his family. Beginning in 1933, local Nazis harassed Jewish residents so relentlessly that most left. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue and the remaining Jewish homes were vandalized, after which the last 11 Jews left Korschenbroich. During the war, French POWs were housed in what remained of the synagogue building. The synagogue was finally torn down in 1959; members of the surviving Jewish community were compensated for the loss of the site. In November 1988, on the 50th anniversary of Pogrom Night, a memorial tablet commemorating the former Jewish community was unveiled in Korschenbroich.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=765,765
Krefeld-Linn,18th century,46 in 1824,42,"During the early 18th century, the Jews of Linn managed their communal affairs in cooperation with neighboring Jewish communities (a number of which used Linn’s Jewish cemetery), for the village was then too small to merit the establishment of an official Jewish community. Although the village was eventually incorporated into the larger town of Krefeld, home to a large Jewish population and a synagogue, Linn Jews continued to conduct services in a rented prayer room.  At some point during the mid-19th century, Philipp de Greiff, a wealthy Christian silk manufacturer, bequeathed his entire assets for the purpose of building a synagogue in a suitable location; after much debate, it was decided to build the new house of worship in Linn. In 1865, the large building was erected at 92 Rheinbabenstrasse. We also know that the synagogue’s dome was renovated in 1926. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue building on fire. The flames, however, failed to damage the sturdy outer walls— those were torn down by the fire brigade the following day.

Kreuzburg,1414,406 in 1869,160,"The modern Jewish community of Kreuzburg (present-day Poland) was founded in or around 1772, after which the Jewish population steadily increased (10% of the total population in 1847). Kreuzburg Jews—most were initially cash-strapped peddlers and shopkeepers—conducted services in nearby Kraskau until 1845, when a wealthy wine merchant helped finance the construction of a prayer hall and an adjacent community center, the latter of which housed a mikveh. The economy of the town improved during the second half of the 19th century, spurred on by the presence of wealthy Jewish merchants and army contractors; many fashionable clothing and footwear shops were opened in the town center, as was a Jewish hotel. The community soon outgrew its prayer hall, and in 1886 Rabbi Ferdinand Rosenthal consecrated a new synagogue whose architectural style incorporated both Moorish and Romanesque features. Kreuzburg was home to many Jewish social and cultural institutions, including a Zionist society, a Jewish war veterans’ association, a ladies’ aid society and a chevra kadisha. Although the Nazis could not enforce their anti-Jewish legislation in Kreuzburg until 1937—the region was protected by the League of Nations’ convention on minority rights—the city was a hotbed of anti-Semitic activity; discrimination and violence were rife, and many Jews left during the 1930s. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue and Jewish-owned stores were set on fire, after which most Jews left Kreuzburg. According to records, only one Jew lived there in November 1942.

Most Kroeffelbach Jews were cattle and produce dealers, and met for prayer services, as documented in 1856, in a rented room in one of the village’s houses. The house owner, however, eventually needed the property for himself, and the Jews, under threat of eviction, secured permission and, subsequently, funding to build a purpose-built synagogue in 1895 (with seats for 28 men and 16 women). Provisions were also made for religious instruction and a mikveh. In 1933 and again in August 1935, the synagogue was broken into and damaged. On Pogrom Night, a group of Nazis from outside the village vandalized the synagogue’s interior, set it on fire and destroyed the ruins. The few remaining Jews were then forcibly moved into one house; most had left before the transportations to the East began, but many Kroeffelbach Jews were deported from other places in Germany.

Services were conducted in private residences until 1884, when the community inaugurated a synagogue on Baeckereigasse. Jews from neighboring towns attended that synagogue’s services; in 1902, the Jews of Sonnenberg joined the Kuestrin community. We also know that in 1934, a new synagogue was inaugurated on Seidelstrasse. Other communal institutions included a school and a cemetery, the latter of which was located on the corner of Gueterbahnhofstrasse and Seidelstrasse (and was enlarged in 1899). In 1932/33, Kuestrin was home to 150 Jews; 15 schoolchildren received religious instruction, and a chevra kadisha and a Jewish literature club were active in the community. After the implementation of the anti-Jewish boycott (April 1, 1933), Jewish-owned businesses were vandalized and damaged. Many Jews left the town during the following months, so that only 96 still lived there in June 1933. Additional anti-Jewish measures were announced in the autumn of 1934. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, and local Jewish men were arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen. By May 1939, Kuestrin’s Jewish population had dropped to 24. At least 14 Kuestrin Jews perished in the Shoah.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, LJG, YV  www.sztetl.org.pl/  www.cuestrin.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=773,773
Kusel,14th century (perhaps earlier),70 in 1936,56,"Jews were persecuted in Kusel during the Black Death pogroms of 1349. In 1542, local Jews were expelled from the region, as were all Jews living in the Duchy of Zweibruecken. It was not until the mid-18th century that Jewish presence was re-established in the town. In 1844, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Ziegelgasse. Burials, however, were conducted in Thallichtenberg. Fifty-six Jews lived in Kusel in 1933. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters vandalized the synagogue, destroyed its interior and damaged Jewishowned stores and houses. Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Fifteen Kusel Jews managed to escape to safe countries, approximately 30 went to countries that were later occupied by the Nazis, and the others relocated within Germany. On October 22, 1940, the remaining Jews were  deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least 23 Jews from Kusel perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building—used as a public bathhouse after 1938—was torn down in 1982 or 1984.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, IAJGS, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=776,776
Kuppenheim,15th century,142 in 1864,51,"The Jews of Kuppenheim initially conducted services in private residences. The community established its first synagogue, on Geitzengasse, at some point between the years 1755 to 1789; in 1826, a new synagogue was inaugurated at Loewengasse. Later, in 1838, the old house of worship was replaced by a new community center housing a mikveh and a school, whose teacher also served as the shochet and chazzan. The Jewish cemetery on Stadtwaldstrasse, consecrated in 1692, served many of the surrounding Jewish communities; in 1889, a burial hall was built there. By 1938, all Jewish-owned businesses had been closed down or appropriated by “Aryans.” On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down and its ritual objects were destroyed. Many locals, including children, watched the destruction. Jewish homes were heavily damaged, a Jewish woman was beaten and Jewish men were sent to Dachau, where one died. Two days later, the burial hall was burned down. Twenty-three local Jews emigrated, eight relocated in Germany, six died in Kuppenheim and 16 were deported to Gurs in October 1940. At least 35 Kuppenheim Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue ruins—the site had been sold in 1938—were demolished in 1950. A memorial stone and placard were later unveiled there (as of 1999, the site has been called Synagogenplatz, or “synagogue square”).","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, HU, PK-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=775,775
Kyllburg,19th century,43 in 1933,,"Jews did not settle in Kyllburg until the 19th century, for the Archbishopric of Trier, to which Kyllburg belonged, forbade Jews from settling in the area before then. In 1911, after a Catholic resident bequeathed his assets to the Jewish community, a synagogue was inaugurated in Kyllburg. Jewish burials, however, were conducted in nearby Malberg. Forty-three Jews lived in Kyllburg in 1933, the town’s peak Jewish population. A regional teacher/chazzan instructed eight Jewish schoolchildren in religion. By 1933, the Jews of Malberg and Speicher had been affiliated with the Kyllburg community. The synagogue was completely destroyed on Pogrom Night, November 1938. In all, 33 Kyllburg Jews emigrated from and six relocated within Germany. In 1942, six Kyllburg Jews and two from Malberg were deported, destined for Kovno (presentday Kaunas), Minsk, Auschwitz and Theresienstadt. At least 12 Jews originally from Kyllburg perished in the Shoah. In 1983, the Malberg municipality renovated the synagogue, which had been desecrated several times in the years 1933 to 1943; later, in 1988, a memorial plaque was unveiled at a church opposite the spot on which the synagogue once stood.","Nurit Borut  Sources: DZG, EJL, LPB, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=777,777
Laasphe,1640,151 in 1819,121,"In Laasphe, Jewish congregational regulations were issued in 1721. By 1750, the community had built a synagogue—the second floor accommodated an apartment for the teacher—at 44 Mauerstrasse. It was in 1750, too, that a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Laasphe. In 1869, the same year in which a mikveh was installed in the synagogue, the community enlarged the main sanctuary. Other renovations and additions were carried out during the ensuing decades, and we also know that, by 1931, the synagogue’s gallery encompassed three sides of the interior. From in 1857 onwards, local Jewish children studied religion with sporadically employed tutors. Laasphe’s Jewish elementary school was founded in 1869. In 1892, Adolf Stoecker’s anti-Jewish party won 43 percent of the local vote. Jewish children were excluded from public schools in 1934, several years before this became common practice in Germany. In 1935, a Zionist group was founded in Laasphe. On Pogrom Night, SS men forced their way into the synagogue and, together with local residents, demolished and plundered its interior; outside the building, Torah scrolls and books were burned. The building, however, was not set on fire, for the rioters feared potential damage to neighboring structures. Sixty-two Laasphe Jews were deported; only two survived the Shoah. The synagogue building was later converted into a locksmith’s workshop. A memorial plaque has been erected in the town.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=778,778
Lage,1679,68 in 1880 (25% of the total population),13,"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Lage is a writ of protection (Schutzbrief) dated 1679. By 1901 at the latest, local Jews had inaugurated a synagogue on 87 Lange Strasse. The Jewish population growth of the late 19th century necessitated a larger house of worship, in response to which the community inaugurated a new synagogue at Friedrichstrasse. Other communal institutions included a cemetery—consecrated on Flurstrasse in the mid-1700s—and a Jewish school, the latter of which was located next to the synagogue (closed down in 1920). The community’s mikveh was located in the synagogue’s basement. In 1928, the Jewish communities of Detmond and Lage merged: Jews from both towns attended synagogue services in Detmond; burials were conducted in Lage. In the summer of 1935, Lage’s synagogue, defunct for seven years, was wrecked. The municipality purchased the building on October 26, 1938 (roughly two weeks before Pogrom Night) after which it ordered that both the synagogue and nearby Jewish school be burned down. The community had ceased to function by Pogrom Night (November 1938), with its remaining Jews moving to Detmold or to other cities. According to Yad Vashem, at least 11 local Jews were killed in the Shoah.

Ladenburg was the seat of a district rabbinate from 1827 until 1875. Prayer services were initially conducted in rented halls. By the beginning of the 19th century, local Jews had established a synagogue; in 1832, a new house of worship—it housed a mikveh, a school and an apartment for a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan—was inaugurated. The community consecrated a cemetery in 1848. In 1933, 18 schoolchildren received religious instruction. A group called the United Israelite District Foundations (Vereinigte Israelitische Ortsstiftungen) brought together numerous local Jewish associations; and branches of Zionist and Orthodox associations were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, the teacher’s home and the synagogue were vandalized; the synagogue’s roof was damaged, its windows were smashed and ritual objects were destroyed. Jewish homes were damaged that night, and Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Forty-four Jews moved to Ladenburg after 1933. Fiftyfour local Jews relocated within Germany, nine died in Ladenburg and 27 were deported to Gurs in October 1940. At least 53 Ladenburg Jews perished in the Shoah.

Lahr,unknown,143 in 1905,96,"The Jewish community of Lahr was destroyed during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. It was not until 1862 that Jews were allowed to return to Lahr; in 1888, they established a community and inaugurated a prayer hall on Bismarckstrasse. Although local Jews were able to maintain a school—the teacher also served as the shochet and chazzan— they conducted burials in nearby Schmieheim. Prominent local Jews included the Weil family, whose steel plant was one of the largest in Europe. The prayer hall was sold in September 1938, after which prayers were conducted in a private residence. Later on Pogrom Night, rioters ravaged Jewish-owned homes and businesses, demolished the former prayer hall and threw out its ritual objects. Jews were dragged from their homes, and the men were sent to Dachau. The following morning, the remaining Jews were marched through the town. In 1939, those Jews who still lived in Lahr were forcibly moved into so-called “Jews’ houses.” Thirty-nine Lahr Jews emigrated, 30 relocated within Germany, nine died in Lahr and 21 were deported to Gurs in October 1940. Three Jews who were married to Christians managed to remain in Lahr, but a fourth was deported to Theresienstadt in 1945. At least 61 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

Lambsheim,unknown,184 in 1848,28,"It was not until the mid-17th century that a lasting Jewish presence was established in Lambsheim.

The school, which had been built inside the synagogue, closed down in 1874, after which a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet instructed children in religion. By 1933, the Jews of Weisenheim (18) and Eppstein (1) had been affiliated with the Lambsheim community. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938) SA men and Hitler Youth tried to burn down the Lambsheim synagogue, but were deterred by the likelihood of damaging the surrounding buildings. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed, however, and Jewish-owned businesses and homes were heavily vandalized. In all, 14 Lambsheim Jews emigrated and 11 relocated within Germany. On October 22, 1940, the village’s eight remaining Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least 13 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

Landau,1273,821 in 1900,596,"Although Jews were persecuted in Landau during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, a Jewish presence was re-established there in 1354. Later, at some point during the 15th century, the Jewish community disappeared from Landau. It was not until 1517 that Jews were permitted to return to the town. Landau was home to a synagogue in the 14th and 15th centuries and to a prayer room in the 16th century. Another synagogue, established in 1648, burned down in 1691, after which it was rebuilt. In 1884, the modern community inaugurated a synagogue at 3 Kaiserstrasse. We also know that the Jews of Landau maintained a mikveh. A private Jewish school and a district rabbinate were established in Landau in 1837 and 1838, respectively. After the school closed down in 1869, the community employed a teacher of religion who took on some of the duties of the chazzan; a second chazzan served as the community’s shochet and accountant. Landau’s Jewish cemetery—it was consecrated in, at the latest, 1532—was confiscated in 1688, after which burials were conducted in Essingen until 1847, when the community consecrated a new cemetery. In 1933, 596 Jews lived in Landau and 13 in the affiliated village of Arzheim; 94 children received religious instruction. Five Jewish associations and a welfare organization were active in the community. Landau’s district rabbi was Dr. Berthold Einstein, who was succeeded in 1935 by Kurt Metzger. Five Jews of Polish origin were deported to Poland in October 1938. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), axewielding SS men burned down the synagogue and destroyed Jewish homes.

Landsberg an der Warthe (Brandenburg Neumark) - today in Poland,probably in the 14th century,450 in 1910,435,"Although we do not know when exactly Jews first settled in Landsberg an der Warthe (present-day Gorzow Wielkopolski, Poland), circumstantial evidence suggests the mid-14th century. Records from 1557 mention a prayer hall, but in 1573—or, according to another source, 1510—all Jews were expelled from the town. Jews fleeing the Swedish invasion of Poland found shelter in Landsberg in 1655/60, so that by the end of the 17th century, the foundation of a permanent Jewish community had been established. In 1755, the community built a synagogue at an unknown location; just shy of a century later, in 1854, a new synagogue was inaugurated on Baderstrasse. The community also maintained a mikveh, a Talmud Torah school, a Jewish hospital, a home for the poor and a cemetery. As one of the largest Jewish communities in the Brandenburg region, Landsberg was home to famous Jewish personalities: among these was Victor Klemperer, the renowned writer and literary critic (son of Rabbi Wilhelm Klemperer). By 1933, Landsberg’s 435 Jews had access to branches of several Jewish organizations, the B’nai B’rith society and the Union of Liberal Judaism among them. Anti-Jewish incidents, often violent, were common after 1932; accordingly, local branches of the German Zionist Organization and He‑Halutz (a Zionist youth pioneer movement) were founded in Landsberg in 1934. The synagogue was burned to the ground on Pogrom Night. By 1939, only 95 Jews still lived in Landsberg; by November 1944, that number had plummeted to four. While we do not possess concrete information on the fate of those Jews who lived in Landsberg in 1939, it is likely that they were deported to the East. Except for a few neglected gravestones, there are no extant signs of the town’s glorious Jewish history.

Records from 1823 mention a Jewish prayer hall, and we also know that in or around 1860, four years after purchasing the land, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Hintergasse; the building accommodated 50 male worshipers and a women’s gallery. In 1895, the Jews of neighboring Bretzenheim and Laubenheim were affiliated with the Langenlonsheim community. Langenlonsheim was home to 40 Jewish residents in 1933; six Jews lived in Laubenheim. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior—the walls, doors, windows and floor—was destroyed; furniture and silver ritual objects were stolen. In April 1940, the building was sold at a greatly reduced price. Although some Langenlonsheim Jews managed to emigrate from Germany, most relocated within the country. In 1939, five Jewish families still resided in the village. Langenlonsheim’s last three Jews were deported in 1942. At least 20 Jews originally from Langenlonsheim and two from Laubenheim perished in the Shoah.

Langenselbold,1682,178 in 1861,226,"Records from 1682 mention two Jewish families in Langenselbold. A Jewish community developed there in the late 17th or early 18th century. In the years 1682 to 1714, services were conducted in a synagogue at 17 Rotehohl, after which the community attended a synagogue on the Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”). In 1849, a synagogue was established in a farmhouse at 41 Steinweg; the dedication of a new Torah scroll was celebrated there in 1903, and we also know that the synagogue was enlarged in 1907. Other communal institutions included a mikveh, a cemetery (18th century) and a Jewish elementary school (closed in 1934), the last of which was located at 43 Steinweg and was presided over by a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan. The community was affiliated with the rabbinate of Hanau. In 1933, 226 Jews lived in Langenselbold. That year, a teacher instructed 11 schoolchildren at Jewish elementary school. Four welfare associations looked after the sick: an Israelite women’s association (1905), two benevolent societies and a Schomer Mizwoh-Verein, or “association of the mitzvah-observant” (1923). The town council introduced severe anti-Jewish measures in 1935, whereupon several Jewish families emigrated or moved to other German cities. On Pogrom Night, SA troops and members of the local Hitler Youth damaged the synagogue’s interior, smashed its windows, burned Torah scrolls in the courtyard and destroyed the community’s hearse. Jewish men were arrested and sent to Buchenwald. In 1939, 96 Jews lived in Langenselbold, 17 of whom moved to Frankfurt am Main. The remaining Jews were deported in 1941 and 1942. Records tell us that the synagogue was converted into a kindergarten belonging to the Nazi Welfare Organization in 1941. At least 110 Langenselbold Jews perished in the Shoah. Sold to a physician after the war, the synagogue building was converted into an apartment building in the 1960s.

Langstadt,1780,approximately 50 in 1865,unknown,"The Jews of Langstadt initially belonged to the Jewish community of Babenhausen. In the 19th century, they temporarily formed an independent community with the Jews of Kleestadt and Schlierbach; membership soon declined, however, and the Langstadt Jews were once again affiliated with Babenhausen. Always small, the community peaked at approximately 50 members in 1865. Local Jews maintained a synagogue, first documented in 1780, at 1-2 Friedhofstrasse; in 1820, the synagogue was moved to the front of the building. Burials were conducted in Babenhausen, but the Jews of Langstadt maintained their own mikveh and, apparently, a classroom. During the 19th century, a teacher instructed Jewish schoolchildren in religion. In 1936, 11 Jews still lived in Langstadt; as late as 1937, a Jew was married in the town. On Pogrom Night, SA troops vandalized the interior of the synagogue and destroyed the ritual items. The building was expropriated in October 1939. Six Jews managed to immigrate to the United States after 1936, and six others were apparently deported. At least 17 Langstadt Jews and seven from Kleestadt perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was demolished in 1964.

A Jewish cemetery was located on the outskirts of town. The Langerwehe Jews belonged to the regional Jewish community of Dueren. Jews from nearby towns attended the Hauptstrasse synagogue, and in 1828 Langerwehe became Dueren’s largest Jewish congregation. In Langerwehe, local Jews were known for organizing charitable activities that benefited the entire town. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior, tearing down the gallery and looting furniture and its other contents. The building was forcibly sold a few months after the pogrom; destroyed by artillery fire during the war, it was later rebuilt. At least 22 Langerwehe Jews perished in the camps.

Laubach,1710,115 in 1861 (5.4% of the total population),35,"In 1789, the Jewish community of Laubach inaugurated a synagogue at 25 Untere Lippe, replacing an earlier prayer room; the synagogue was enlarged at the end of the 19th century (to contain 48 seats for men, 30 for women) and renovated in 1929. A Jewish elementary school was opened in 1823, but it closed shortly afterwards, at which point the community began to employ teachers who also served as ritual slaughterers and cantors. In 1906, a local pharmacist purchased the mikveh—it had been built in 1811—dismantled it and put it back together in the garden behind his pharmacy, where it still stands. Laubach’s Jewish cemetery, on Hungener Strasse, was consecrated in or around the year 1800. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; Torah scrolls, ritual objects and furniture were loaded onto the community’s hearse, taken to a square and set on fire. Six Jewish homes were ransacked, and all remaining Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald. Twelve Jews emigrated (eight went to the United States), 17 relocated within Germany and two left for unknown destinations. The last four Jews of Laubach, and a family of four from Ruppertsburg (an affiliated community), were deported to Poland and to Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 14 Laubach Jews and seven from Ruppertsburg perished in the Shoah.

Laudenbach,unknown,158 in 1858,13,"We know that the modern Jewish community in Laudenbach had established a synagogue by 1747; also, records for that year mention a Jewish school master. In 1787, when this synagogue was no longer safe to use, the community requested permission to build a new one; permission was granted on condition that the synagogue would not be located near a church or on a street through which church processions marched. The synagogue was built in 1799/1800. Although a school was opened near the new house of worship in 1828, it was shut down in 1911 as a result of insufficient enrollment. According to records, the community used the Weikersheim cemetery after 1729. The synagogue interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night; the ritual objects, however, had been moved to Bad Mergentheim at some point before the pogrom, when the community could no longer gather 10 men for a minyan. Although two elderly Jews were sent to Dachau that night, they were released on the way. Later, in December 1938, members of the SA were fatally injured while trying to blow up the synagogue building. Laudenbach’s remaining Jews were deported to Riga (in December 1941) and Theresienstadt (August 1942). At least 10 Laudenbach Jews perished in the Shoah.

Lauchheim,1658,176 in 1858,7,"Jews first settled in Lauchheim in 1658; that same year, six Jews who had been expelled from the county of Oettingen- Baldern found refuge in Lauchheim despite the opposition of Father Philipp Freiherr von Grafeneck. Most Jews lived on the Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley” (present-day Bleichstrasse), and although the community suffered a series of pogroms, Christian residents often protected their Jewish neighbors from the violence. The community inaugurated a synagogue in, at the latest, 1686; its location is not known, but records do tell us that the building burned down in 1743, after which, during the years 1768 to 1770, a new synagogue was built in Lauchheim (with the permission of the local count). Lauchheim became the headquarters of a regional rabbinate in 1716, the same year in which the community first employed a Jewish teacher. Other communal institutions included a Jewish school and a mikveh, both of which were built on the corner of 15 Bienner Strasse and Pfarrer-Bestlin-Strasse in the mid-1850s. Burials were conducted in nearby Aufhausen. Prominent Lauchheim rabbis included Joseph Bloch and Shmuel Bloch. In 1920, because many Jews had left Lauchheim in the early 20th century, the community was disbanded. Those Jews who stayed on were affiliated with the community in Oberdorf, and the synagogue was eventually sold to a private buyer. In 1933, only seven Jews still lived in Lauchheim. On Pogrom Night, Nazis unsuccessfully attempted to burn down the former synagogue building. According to Yad Vashem, at least 18 Lauchheim Jews were killed during the Shoah. Lauchheim is no longer home to a Jewish community. The local museum of history houses a few Jewish artifacts, commemorating the history of the community.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=799,799
Langweiler,1800,80 in the mid-19th century,7,"The Jews of Langweiler conducted services in a modest prayer house between the years 1840 to 1854, when a modest synagogue was built on Dorfstrasse. On the synagogue’s 75th anniversary, the inner room (where up to 100 Jews attended weekly services) was adorned with beautiful paintings and a large chandelier. Founded in 1843, the community’s school was the Aachen district’s first officially recognized Jewish elementary and religious school. Although local residents managed to prevent the incineration of the synagogue building on Pogrom Night, its interior was nevertheless destroyed; eyewitness reports tell us that rioters swung from the chandelier and used axes to demolish the synagogue’s contents. Langweiler’s three remaining Jewish homes were attacked that night. During the war, Polish forced laborers were housed in the synagogue building. We also know that the site was used as a warehouse for agricultural equipment until the 1960s, when the building was demolished to make room for coal mines. Headstones from Langweiler’s Jewish cemetery were eventually moved to Dueren.

Lauenburg,1752,381 in 1871,239,"The history of Jewish Lauenburg (present-day Lobork, Poland) began relatively late: in the mid-18th century, the few Jewish families who lived there were scattered throughout the town and its surrounding areas. It was during the 19th century that the growing community established its institutions: two cemeteries, the first of which was probably founded before 1800; a sisterhood; a chevra kadisha; and, in 1830 or 1845, a synagogue on Stockturmstrasse. Between 1871 and 1911, the community employed a series of rabbis, each of whom served for a short period. After 1911, cantors and other officials guided the spiritual life of the community, of which Jewish merchants from nearby villages, including Isidor Stein of Chottshow, were members. In 1881, anti-Jewish riots, which had started in Neustettin, erupted in Lauenburg too. Nevertheless, the size of this particular community did not decrease as did that of most others. The Nazi boycott crippled Jewish-owned businesses in Lauenburg. On November 10, 1938, the synagogue and morgue (the one located in the second cemetery) were burned down. At least 180 Lauenburg Jews were eventually murdered in concentration camps.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, FJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=802,802

The community established a synagogue in 1736, another synagogue, on Bandwoerthstrasse, in 1794 (renovated in 1836) and a mikveh, school and matzo bakery. In 1865/66, the cemetery was desecrated during a pogrom. This pogrom was followed by more anti-Jewish riots in June 1866. In 1933, several Jewish associations were active in Laudenbach, including a branch of the Zionist movement. In September 1938 (during the Sudeten Crisis), local youths broke windows in the synagogue and in ten Jewish homes. One Jewish man was wounded. On Pogrom Night, furniture and ritual objects in the synagogue were smashed or burned. Jewish homes were severely damaged. Twenty-one Laudenbach Jews emigrated, 40 relocated within Germany and 11 were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in April 1942. Laudenbach’s last two Jews were deported to Theresienstadt (also via Wuerzburg) in September 1942. At least 24 Laudenbach Jews perished in the Shoah.

Laupheim,,843 in 1869,325,"By 1856, this Jewish community was the largest in Wuerttemberg. A rabbi was appointed in 1745, and Laupheim hosted a regional rabbinate between 1832 and 1922. Services were initially conducted in a private residence. Local Jews consecrated a cemetery after 1730, and records tell us that it was enlarged on several occasions. A synagogue was built near the cemetery in 1771, and it was there that Jews congregated until 1822, when the community inaugurated a new house of worship. When that new synagogue quickly fell into disrepair, yet another synagogue—it housed a mikveh— was inaugurated in Laupheim in 1836/37. We also know that the Jewish school, which had been founded in 1823, was moved to the new rabbinate house (opposite the synagogue) in 1829; and in 1868, the school was moved yet again—this time to its own building. According to records, the 19thcentury community maintained a school for girls. In 1933, several Jewish associations and branches of national organizations were active in Laupheim; eleven pupils attended the school. Jewish-owned businesses were frequently attacked in 1935 and in 1936. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire while Jewish men were forced to perform exercise drills in front of the burning building; approximately 40 men were sent to Dachau that night. The community was dissolved in 1939, by which point the Jews of Laupheim and other communities had been forcibly moved into huts on a camp. Seventy-three Jews moved to Laupheim during the Nazi period. At least 134 emigrated, many of whom were aided by Laupheim native Carl Laemmle, founder of Universal Studios in Hollywood.

From the 15th to the Early 19th Century During the following centuries, Jewish life in Leipzig was mainly shaped by Jewish merchants who attended, in great numbers, the Leipzig fairs three times a year. They were accommodated in the medieval Jewish quarter and, beginning in the 17th century, in Bruehl. Between 1688 and 1764, nearly 82,000 Jewish merchants, mainly from Eastern Europe, participated in the Leipzig fairs. After 1710, “protected Jews” were permitted to settle in Leipzig; their numbers, however, remained low for decades (1784/85: six families).  Although the merchants, also known as Messejuden, or “fair Jews,” were handicapped by several discriminatory restrictions, they played an important role in the city’s economy, and contributed greatly to Leipzig’s development as a center of the fur trade. The restrictions were gradually lifted, and Jews were eventually permitted to establish prayer rooms for use during fair periods. Merchants from Eastern Europe, as well as from Hamburg and Berlin, established several such prayer rooms, such as the Orthodox Brody Shul (in Bruehl) in 1763/64. A burial site was consecrated on Stephanstrasse in 1814, and by 1835 the city was home to seven prayer rooms in total.   The 19th Century until the Rise of Hitler  In response to the political changes taking place in Saxony from 1830 onwards, the Leipzig governmental authorities relaxed their stance on Jewish emancipation and civil rights. The modern Jewish community, the founders of which were merchants from Brody/Galicia, came into being in 1834. Twelve years later, in 1846, the ministry of cultural affairs officially recognized the community. In 1837/38, Jews were granted the right to settle in Leipzig permanently, to purchase property and, under certain conditions, to establish congregations. The community’s first proper synagogue, a liberal house of worship, was built on the corner of Gottschedstrasse and Zentralstrasse in 1855. Rabbi Abraham Goldschmidt was appointed in 1858; his wife, Henriette Goldschmidt, was an active member of the German women’s movement.  Leipzig was home to two Jewish cemeteries: on Berliner Strasse (1864) and on Delitzscher Strasse (1925). Other communal institutions included a mikveh (1870), a broad range of schools for religious studies (established in 1848, 1912, and 1926/27, respectively), a hospital (1929) and an old-age home (1931). Beginning in 1925, the community published a newsletter.  As a result of the arrival in Leipzig of an influx of Eastern European Jews, especially after 1900, many small, Orthodox synagogues and prayer rooms were established there, such as the synagogues Brody, Kolomea, Beth Jehuda, Ahavath Torah, and Ohel Yaakov, all of which followed the religious and cultural traditions of their congregants’ native cities. In 1922, the Orthodox Ez Chaim synagogue was inaugurated on Apels Garten; Ephraim Carlebach (1879- 1936), who was well-known for, among other achievements, founding Leipzig’s Orthodox Jewish secondary school, served as rabbi.  In 1925, Leipzig’s Jewish population peaked at 13,030, the largest Jewish community in Saxony and the sixthlargest in Germany. Hugely influential in the community were members of the Jewish upper middle-class, including businessmen, craftsmen, white-collar workers, intellectuals, physicians, and lawyers.  Leipzig Jews also contributed to the arts and sciences: Paul Ehrlich and Victor Ehrenberg taught at the university; Max Eitingon was an important figure in the field of psychiatry; Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy founded the first German conservatory in 1843; and Moritz Kohner became the first Jewish member of the city council in 1874. In Leipzig, anti-Semitism intensified in 1880/90. Several anti-Semitic newspapers appeared around this time, and Eastern European Jews were often assaulted. A local Nazi group was founded in the city in 1922, not long after which, in 1924, the Ez Chaim synagogue was smeared with swastikas.   The Nazi Era  When Hitler came to power in 1933, Jewish community life was flourishing: 11,564 Jews lived in Leipzig, and 189 schoolchildren were enrolled at the Jewish elementary school on Gustav-Adolf-Strasse; others attended Jewish secondary or Hebrew-language schools, as well as schools for religious studies, and still others received private religious instruction. Numerous Jewish associations and institutions, as well as nearly 100 foundations, were involved in welfare, social and cultural work. We also know that Zionist groups and branches of national Jewish organizations were active in the community that year.  As a result of the anti-Jewish boycott of April 1, 1933, local Jews were exposed to increasingly dire anti-Semitic measures, for example, dismissal from work, exclusion from general associations, raids and property confiscation. In 1938, 45 Jews were arrested, of whom 31 were taken to Sachsenhausen; in October of 1938 and in early 1939, more than 2,650 Jews of Polish origin were expelled from Leipzig. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA men and local members of the Nazi Party incinerated synagogues and prayer rooms, destroyed several other communal institutions, desecrated Jewish cemeteries and vandalized Jewish-owned homes and stores. More than 550 Jews were arrested that night; 270 were taken to Buchenwald, where eight of them died.  Between 1933 and November 1938, approximately 3,000 local Jews emigrated. In May 1939, 4,284 Jews remained in Leipzig. In 1941, Jews were forcibly moved into approximately 50 designated “Jews’ houses” and subjected to forced labor. Between January 1942 and February 1945, more than 2,500 Jews were deported from Leipzig, in a total of nine transports, to Riga, Lublin, Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and other concentration camps. Twenty Jews committed suicide to avoid deportation. Several thousand Leipzig Jews perished in the Shoah.    After World War II  In May 1945, a new Jewish community was founded in Leipzig, soon after which, in October, the community conducted its first prayer service at the Brody Synagogue (on Keilstrasse). In response to the fact that, beginning in 1991, hundreds of Jews from the former Soviet Union moved to the city, community membership rose significantly; so much so that in 1998 local Jews hired a rabbi. Leipzig’s Jewish population figure for 2007 was 1,300. In 2001, a memorial was unveiled at the site of Leipzig’s former main synagogue on Gottschedstrasse. At the Ephraim Carlebach School—in 1935, the Jewish secondary school was renamed in his honor—a memorial plaque commemorates the deportees. As of this writing, at least 150 memorial stumbling stones have been unveiled in Leipzig.

Leiwen,1592,61 in 1930,45,"The modern Jewish community of Leiwen conducted services in a prayer room on the corner of Bahnhofstrasse and Hannagass (later renamed Euchariusstrasse and Laurentiusstrasse, respectively) until 1913, when a synagogue was inaugurated on Roemerstrasse. Local Jews also maintained a mikveh and a school for religious studies, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Records do not tell us when the community consecrated its cemetery, but the oldest gravestones are dated 1863. By 1933, the Jews of nearby Loesnich and Kluesserath had been affiliated with the Leiwen community. Later, in 1937, vandals smashed windows on the synagogue’s left side and cut down several decorative trees. On Pogrom Night, SA men and local members of the Nazi party ransacked Leiwen’s synagogue and chased local Jews to the banks of the Mosel River, where they forced the Jews to burn the synagogue’s Torah scrolls and ritual objects. The homes of the village’s 11 remaining Jews were ransacked, after which all Jews left Leiwen. The Jewish cemetery was partially destroyed during the Nazi period. At least 32 Leiwen Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue, which the Nazis appropriated after Pogrom Night, served as a kindergarten and later, as a detention center for French POWs. Sold to a wine firm after 1945 and used for a while as a storage site, the building was eventually demolished. A memorial plaque has been unveiled at the renovated cemetery.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, FJW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=820,820
Lemfoerde,1690,67 in 1852 (total population,unknown,"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Lemfoerde, dated 1690, mentions one Levi Heidemann. Jews conducted services in a prayer room until 1817, when the community purchased a building on Hauptstrasse and converted the structure into a synagogue and school; behind the synagogue, in a separate building, the community built a mikveh. The cemetery, located on land purchased in 1731 (at Quernheim) was used until 1934. We also know that the community, with which, beginning in 1875, the Jews of Deibergen, Holden, Hunteberg and Wehdem were affiliated, maintained an elementary school between 1853 and 1912. On Pogrom Night, SA men ransacked the synagogue and burned its contents in the marketplace; the synagogue’s inscription, “My house is a house of prayer for all peoples,” was also destroyed. A former resident of Lemfoerde, then living in Bassum, committed suicide after Nazis destroyed her home and arrested her husband, In all, 12 Lemfoerde Jews perished in Auschwitz, eight in Warsaw, seven in Theresienstadt, three in Riga, two in Trostinec Maly, one in Sobibor and three in combat. We also know that one local Jew died on the transport to Auschwitz, and that another was murdered in Minsk in July 1942. After the Shoah, silver ritual objects from the synagogue— the synagogue is now privately owned—were discovered in the attic of the Martin Luther Church.

Lengerich,1576,105 in 1849,32,"The first available record of a Jewish presence in Lengerich is dated 1576. During the 16th and 17th centuries, most local Jews were Schutzjuden, that is to say, “protected Jews” who had received a letter of protection from the local authorities, limited to a quota. In the 18th century, but especially in the 19th, the Jewish population experienced considerable growth, peaking at 105 in 1849 (the largest Jewish community in the area). Services were conducted in private prayer halls until June 15, 1821, when Rabbi Abraham Sutro inaugurated a synagogue at 163 Parzelle. The community founded a Jewish school in 1829, and we also know that in 1856, the statutes for the Lengerich synagogue district (including Tecklenburg and Ladbergen) were officially recognized. The Nazis’ anti-Jewish boycott (announced in 1933) was enforced zealously in Lengerich. As a result of the ensuing violence and discrimination, many Jews left Lengerich during the 1930s. On Pogrom Night, Nazis demolished and, in some cases, burned down Jewish homes and businesses; the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, its ritual objects stolen. Several local Jews were arrested that night. It was in 1938, too, that local Nazis destroyed large sections of the cemetery. An unspecified number of Jews left Lengerich in 1939. The remaining Jews were eventually moved into a so-called “Jews’ house,” from which they were deported to the death camps of the East; five Jews, Lengerich’s last, were deported in December 1941. According to Yad Vashem, at least 35 local Jews were killed in the Shoah. Lengerich is no longer home to a Jewish community.

Leobschuetz,1360,302 in 1862,111,"Although Jews lived in Leobschuetz (present-day Glubczyce, Poland) for approximately 200 years during the Middle Ages—records from that time mention a Jewish-owned brewery—they were expelled from the town in 1543. It was not until 1810, in fact, that Jews returned to Leobschuetz. The community consecrated two cemeteries—one in 1814, the other in 1892—and maintained a prayer hall in the home of a carpenter (17 Wasserstrasse) until 1865, when a proper synagogue was built on the corner of Kochanowski and Koszarowa. A Jewish sisterhood, a charity for transients and a school for higher education were active in Leobschuetz. Gustav Hollaender (1855-1915), a renowned Berlin violinist, composer and conductor, was born in Leobschuetz. The synagogue was vandalized in 1927, the walls smeared with anti-Semitic slogans. Nevertheless, Nazi authorities were unable to enforce their racist laws until 1937, as Leobschuetz was protected by the League of Nations’ Minority Rights Convention. On Pogrom Night, however, Jewish Leobschuetz suffered the same fate as did Jewish communities all over Germany. The synagogue was burned to the ground, Jewish-owned stores and homes were destroyed and 10 men were arrested. Seventy-four Leobschuetz Jews perished in the camps.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, FJG, LJG, YV  www.sztetl.org.pl",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=825,825
Lemgo,14th century,111 in 1900,53,"In 1675, the Jewish community of Lemgo was permitted to conduct services in a private residence. The house was sold in 1742, after which Jews prayed in Brake (Brake and Hohenhausen were affiliated communities). At some point in the 19th century, services were conducted in a private residence at 12 Papperstrase, where Jews prayed until the establishment, in 1883, of a synagogue on Neue Strasse. The community established two cemeteries (one in 1850, the other in 1870) and a Jewish elementary school, the latter of which closed down in 1915. Local Jews did not employ a teacher after 1922, but children were able to continue studying religion with teachers from other communities. In 1933, three schoolchildren received religious instruction. Later, in 1935, vandals smashed windows in a Jewish-owned business and vandalized Jewish homes. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire, a Jewishowned business was destroyed and looted, the windows of Jewish homes were broken and the new cemetery was desecrated. Three men were sent to Buchenwald, where one was severely injured. The old cemetery site was closed and leveled shortly afterwards. Four Lemgo Jews emigrated, 23 relocated within Germany and nine died in the town. In 1939, the remaining Jews were moved into four designated houses; and in 1941/42, 28 Jews (including some from the vicinity) were deported, 22 of them to Theresienstadt. At least 33 Lemgo Jews, and three from Brake, perished in the Shoah. A commemorative stone and a memorial were unveiled at the synagogue site in 1963 and 1987, respectively.

Leutershausen,1440,122 in 1815,32,"The earliest available record of a Jewish presence in Leutershausen is from the mid-15th century; a city chronicle (begun in 1440) mentions a Jewish homeowner and the socalled Judeneid or More Judaico, an oath Jews were required to take in a court of law. Records from 1663 and 1686 mention a synagogue; the later record tells us that the house of worship was at that time located at 70 Marktplatz (present-day 29 Markt); by 1755, however, the synagogue had been moved to the town’s southern wall, near the margravial tithe barn. Although the community was able to maintain a least two ritual baths—one next to the synagogue, the other in Moyses Seckel’s home on present-day Mittlere Marktgasse—burials were conducted at the Jewish cemetery in Bechhofen. Jewish children studied religion with teachers, one of whom was named Samuel Suttro, who also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers. As a result of economic hardship, many Jews left Leutershausen during the early 20th century, so that community membership dropped from 62 in 1900 to 32 in 1933. Those who remained, however, were active in local clubs and organizations, including the volunteer fire department, as well as sports clubs. As early as 1932, Juda verrecke (“death to Judas”) was a common slogan at local demonstrations. On October 16, 1938 (a few weeks before Pogrom Night) rioters vandalized the synagogue and wrecked Jewish homes; that night, a local Christian hid the remaining Jews, most of whom left Leutershausen the following day, in his home. No Jews lived in Leutershausen by February 1939, and the synagogue was eventually converted into a barn.

The Jewish population peaked at 60 in 1880, and most local Jews earned their living through the cattle and retail trades. In Levern, a Jewish community was formed in 1822 and officially recognized in 1898. Services were conducted in a private prayer room until April 1873, when the foundation stone for a synagogue was laid at 98 Judenstrasse, or “Jews’ street” (present-day 2 Miliostrasse/Huegelstrasse); the halftimbered building housed an apartment for a teacher. Other communal institutions included a Jewish school (1854- 1921) and a cemetery (1862-1936), the latter of which was consecrated on Highway 770. (Prior to 1862, burials had been conducted in Luebbecke and in Preussisch-Oldendorf.) In 1925, by which time many Jews had left Levern, only 11 Jews still lived there. Services at the synagogue were limited to the High Holidays, and the house of worship was sold in September 1938. Anti-Semitic violence erupted in Levern in 1933 and in 1935. Several weeks before Pogrom Night, in October 1938, a schoolchild set the former synagogue on fire, after which neighboring residents extinguished the blaze. Later, in 1939, a resident purchased the Jewish cemetery, removed 20 gravestones and reforested the site. At least five Levern Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1954, the Jewish cemetery was restored.

As was the case in many German communities, Lich’s Jewish school was presided over by a teacher who performed the duties of shochet and chazzan. We also know that burials were conducted at the cemetery on Am Hardtberg, which had been consecrated, at the latest, at the beginning of the 19th century. Violent anti-Semitic riots erupted in Lich in 1933, riots in which the SA assaulted Jews and vandalized their property. By the spring of 1938, 56 Jews had left Lich. On Pogrom Night, local Jewish men were deported to Buchenwald, where one died. Rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior, burned ritual objects in the street and looted Jewish homes. French POWs were housed in the synagogue during the war. The last five Jews of Lich were deported to Auschwitz in 1942. At least 34 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

Beginning in the 1730s, religious services were conducted in a private residence. In Lichtenau, Jewish children attended regular schools and studied religion at the teacher’s house (built in 1808). In 1810, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Schmiedstrasse (present-day Synagogenstrasse, or “synagogue street”) with 50 seats for men and 36 for women. After 1830, local Jews conducted burials at the Freistatt cemetery.

Liegnitz,1301,"1,085 in 1903",850,"Records suggest that a small group of Jews settled near Liegnitz’s local castle in 1170. We know for certain that a Judenstrasse (“Jews’ street”) existed in the town (present-day Legnice, Poland) during the 14th and 15th centuries, and that that Jewish community maintained a synagogue and a cemetery on Toepferstrasse. Although Liegnitz Jews had their own prayer room, they were initially affiliated with the Glogau regional congregation, whose rabbi also conducted services in Liegnitz. The congregation became independent in 1818. Three Jewish cemeteries were consecrated in Liegnitz: one in 1815, another in 1838 and a third in 1923. Although plans for the construction of a synagogue were made in 1838, it was not until 1847 that one was built in Liegnitz. The consecration ceremony of the Byzantine-style synagogue (on Baeckerstrasse) was held in the presence of the district president and members of the municipality; in 1879/80, structural changes were made to meet the needs of the rapidly growing community. Between 1854 and 1920, the Jews of Liegnitz employed their own rabbi and cantor. A teacher instructed elementary and high school students in religion. The community maintained a convalescent home (established in 1828), a mikveh, charity groups, a society that offered loans for productive investment (in machines and industrial tools, for example) and an artisans’ association. Later, Zionist youth organizations and camps were opened in Liegnitz. After the Nazis’ election victories, these camps prepared potential immigrants to Palestine by instructing them in Hebrew, farming and gardening. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, as were several Jewish-owned stores; Liegnitz’s remaining Jewish men were arrested. The newest cemetery survived Pogrom Night, after which the Judenstrasse was renamed Steubenstrasse.

The Jews of Lieblos engaged mainly in cattle and textile trading, and there was one Jewish baker in the area. The community maintained a synagogue, organized classes in religion, and ran an elementary school (1870-1880) and a mikveh. The synagogue building, built in a centuries-old rural mansion with wood paneling, was evidently purchased by one of the members when the congregation outgrew its prayer hall in the mid-18th century. The interior was altered to include eight benches for the men and a ladies’ gallery. At least 25 congregants attended services in the early 1900s, but by 1933 the community could assemble a minyan only on the High Holidays. The Nazis’ boycott campaign drove even more Jews out of the area, and the adjacent communities had to conduct joint services according to a rotating system. The synagogue was vandalized on Pogrom Night. Although the ritual objects had been sent to Frankfurt, they, too, were destroyed that night.

Lingen’s Jewish school was established at some point between 1875 and 1878; from 1878 to 1890, and again from 1902 onwards, the school offered religious studies only. Although the first available record of a mikveh is dated 1924 or 1925, it is likely that one existed there well before the 20th century. At the cemetery, the oldest stone is dated 1771. In 1933, the community still maintained a chevra kadisha (founded in 1880), a mixed choir and a Jewish welfare organization. Shortly after midnight on November 10, 1938 (Pogrom Night) local SA men set the synagogue on fire. Six Jewish men were arrested and deported to Buchenwald. Although two-thirds of the Jewish population emigrated in the years 1933 to 1939, only eight managed to reach safe locations; most of those who fled to Belgium or the Netherlands were caught and deported to Auschwitz or to Sobibor, where they were murdered.

It was during the 14th century, too, that the Jews of Limburg established a synagogue, a social hall and a mikveh.

Very few Jewish families lived in Limburg during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, and those who did constantly faced bans and discrimination. In 1844, 14 Jewish families lived in Limburg, most of them poor. The economy improved in the mid-19th century, however, and local Jews opened a number of businesses: two large clothing stores, a shoe store, several butcher shops, a soap factory and a private bank. In 1867, the Jewish congregation acquired a chapel and remodeled the building into a synagogue with 80 seats. In response to growing population numbers, a new synagogue (with 201 seats for men, 104 for women) was inaugurated on Unteren Schiede in 1903. It is not clear when the community consecrated the Jewish cemetery on Judenschiede, but records do tell us that it was closed in 1820, after which two other burial sites were used until 1939. The synagogue was looted on Pogrom Night, as were other Jewish-owned properties. The remaining Jews were deported in 1942; in 1944/45, several Jews, all married to ethnic Germans, were taken for forced labor. At least 20 of the deported Jews died. A small memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site in 1981; the cemetery on Beethovenstrasse also houses a plaque, placed there in 1988. Limburg’s new Jewish congregation (200 congregants in 2006) was founded in 1998.","Swetlana Frank  Sources: EJL, FJG, LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=833,833
Linnich,1348,149 in 1887,124,"Jews in Linnich conducted prayer services in a building at 12, Rurdorfer Strasse until the early 20th century. In Linnich, a Jewish private school and a Jewish elementary school were established in 1804 and 1878, respectively. In 1913, the community built an Art Nouveau synagogue—the building also housed a schoolroom, a mikveh, offices and a women’s balcony—on Nordpromenade; the inauguration ceremony was attended by city council officials and high-ranking representatives of other faiths. On Pogrom Night, SA men and local residents from Linnich and Juedlich set the synagogue on fire, destroying the building and its contents (including a precious Chair of Elijah). The Jewish cemetery was desecrated that night, and homes and shops were demolished. Jewish residents were forcibly moved into the “Villa Ruth,” where they were kept until their deportation. At least 49 Linnich Jews perished in the Shoah. A mohel’s book from the synagogue—it survived Pogrom Night—is now on display at the Jewish Museum of Frankfurt.

Linz am Rhein,1219 or 1222,142 in 1892/93,64,"The Jewish community of Linz, formed in the late 16th century, consecrated a synagogue in the early 17th century; a prayer room in 1763; a new synagogue, on Auf dem Berg, in 1851; a cemetery in 1854; and a mikveh on an unspecified date. The community center at 20, Neustrasse (1841) housed a private Jewish school. Classified as a Jewish elementary school in 1881, the school was presided over by a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. By 1911, the school was offering religious instruction only, as a result of which lessons were conducted in the teacher’s apartment. In 1933, nine Jewish children received religious instruction in Linz. Several Jewish associations—a women’s group, charities, and a society for the study of Jewish literature—were active in the community, to which the Jews of Unkel and Rheinbreitbach had been affiliated. The community center was sold in 1936. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the interior of the synagogue and the village’s seven remaining Jewish homes. Later, in September 1940, the remaining Jews were forced to move into a few Jewish-owned houses. Twelve Linz Jews were deported to the East in March 1942, and seven were sent to Theresienstadt in July of the same year. At least 57 Jews originally from Linz, four from Unkel and 15 from Rheinbreitbach perished in the Shoah. Linz’s former synagogue, later used as a warehouse, was converted into a residential building in the mid-1980s.

Loecknitz,19th century,37 in 1925,unknown,"Records suggest that a Jewish family first settled in Loecknitz in the early 19th century. The community, members of which were mainly craftsmen and merchants, never experienced considerable growth. In Loecknitz, Jews established a prayer room on the upper floor of a commercial building, where the rabbi from Pasewalk conducted services three times a year. Local Jews were affiliated with the community in Pasewalk, and it was at the cemetery there that they buried their dead. Beginning in April 1933, Nazis and their supporters often hung boycott posters on Jewish-owned shops. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 10, 1938), SA and SS men vandalized the prayer room, smashing windows and burning—this was done outside the building—furniture, books and ritual objects. A Jewish family was assaulted that night. After the beginning of World War II, Jews were sent to a camp located between Prenzlau and Pasewalk. In February 1940, most local Jews were deported to the concentration and extermination camps in Eastern Europe. At least 18 Loecknitz Jews were murdered in the Shoah. In 1988, a memorial stele was unveiled at the site of the former prayer room. The stele was desecrated several times during 2003, as a result of which it was replaced, in 2010, with a commemorative stone; the stone, too, was vandalized in 2011.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: FJG, LJG, SIA, W-G, YV  www.links-lang.de/presse/11466.php",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=838,838
Lippstadt,1535,270 in 1890,115 or 126,"Although Jews were thought to have lived in Lippstadt from the middle of the 14th- century, the first available record of a Jewish presence there is dated 1535. Prominent Jewish residents included David Gans (born in 1541), the disciple of Rabbi Loew of Prague and one of the first Jewish scholars to engage in secular studies; and the Herz family: the first Jews to become citizens of Prussia (in the 18th century). Lippstadt became the center of a synagogue district in 1853. Lippstadt Jews conducted services in prayer halls, all of which were located in private residences, until July 30, 1852, when a synagogue was inaugurated at 7, Stiftstrasse; the building also accommodated an elementary school. Burials were conducted in a cemetery on Burgstrasse beginning in or around the year 1700 until the 1830s, at which point a new cemetery was consecrated next to the town’s general burial grounds. In October 1935, Jews were banned from local restaurants, a rare measure in Germany at the time. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was incinerated, all Jewish-owned stores were destroyed and 25 Jewish men were sent to the Oranienburg concentration camp. Thirty-eight Jews lived in Lippstadt in 1938; the 18 Jews who still lived there in 1942 were deported and killed. In 1953, the synagogue plot was signed over to the Jewish Trust Corporation, which sold the site in 1954. A memorial plaque was later unveiled at the site, now a historical monument.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=837,837
Loerrach,1660 or 1670,248 in 1875,162,"According to records, the Jewish community of Loerrach established the following institutions: a cemetery in 1670; a mikveh at some point during the 17th century; a prayer hall, located in a private residence, in 1797; a synagogue at Teichstrasse in 1808 (renovated in 1899); a community center in 1819; and, finally, a new cemetery in 1891. Several Jewish associations were active in Loerrach in 1933, and the community continued to offer cultural and social activities well into the Nazi period. The Jews of Schopfheim and Grenzach were affiliated with the Loerrach community. On Pogrom Night, a member of the Gestapo warned the community of the imminent assault; accordingly, the Torah scrolls were hidden. The synagogue, however, was demolished, and Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Approximately two-thirds of the community had left by 1940. On October 22, 1940, 50 Jews were deported to Gurs; two women were deported to Izbica in April 1942. One local Jewish woman—she was married to a Christian— survived the war in Loerrach. At least 77 Loerrach Jews perished during the Shoah. In 1976, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the synagogue site. The old cemetery was restored, and a memorial plaque was unveiled there, too.

Loetzen,Middle Ages,172 in 1873,73,"It was in 1813, when 32 Jews (10 families) settled in Loetzen (Polish: Gizycko), that the foundation for a community was established. Local Jews maintained a cemetery (established in 1807), a synagogue at 5 Boyenstrasse (1880) and a Jewish school. Loetzen was home to several prominent Jews: Paul Moritz Davidsohn (1871-1927), the “father” of the German film industry; Moritz Davidsohn, a prominent textile merchant; Daniel Jacoby and Gabriel Russ, who were involved in municipal politics; and Mrs. Friedlander, who served on the board of the Country Motherland Association. In 1931/32, the leaders of the community were Alfred Levin, L. Masur and a Mr. Schereschewski. Jewish-owned businesses were attacked in 1932, and in 1933, Julius Zacharias and a merchant by the name of Markus were arrested. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down. By May 1939, only 20 Jews lived in Loetzen. Several Loetzen Jews immigrated to the United States, others were caught in the Netherlands and many were deported. The last to leave was probably Miss Gruczinski, a nurse who had been awarded an Iron Cross in World War I; she was arrested by the Gestapo in 1944, but it is reported that she managed to escape from a transport to a concentration camp.

Lohr’s Jewish burials took place at the cemetery in Laudenbach. We also know that in 1918, the local psychiatric institution opened a department for Jewish patients (financed by a Jewish charity association in Aschaffenburg). A teacher from Gemuenden instructed six Jewish schoolchildren in Lohr in 1933. In March 1938, following Germany’s annexation of Austria, Jewish homes were attacked and damaged. On Pogrom Night, SA men ransacked the synagogue and attacked Jewish homes and businesses; two Jews were deported, one to Dachau and one to Buchenwald. Nine Lohr Jews emigrated and 50 relocated within Germany. By February 1939, only two Jewish women remained in the town, both of whom were married to Christians. Later, in September 1940, the 19 Jewish patients at the psychiatric institute were sent to the Eglfing-Haar asylum in Munich; they were then deported to Chelm, in Poland, where 15 were murdered. At least nine Lohr Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial stone was later unveiled on Grafen-von-Rieneck- Strasse.

The community grew slowly, mainly around the market place, and became an independent congregation in 1883. Three years before that, in 1880, the Jews of Loewen had consecrated a cemetery. Services were conducted in a rented prayer room (part of a private residence), and the community also maintained a kosher slaughterhouse. In 1901, the congregation commenced the construction of a synagogue on Dworcowa Street (present-day Kosciuszki Street); in 1907, the house of worship was inaugurated by Leo Baeck, the rabbi of Opole and, later, the leader of progressive Judaism. The synagogue building was burned down on Pogrom Night. During the war, a labor camp, in which Jews were forced to take part in the building of a highway, existed near Loewen.

Ludwigshafen am Rhein,1845,"1,400 in 1931","1,070","The presence of Jews in Ludwigshafen am Rhein was documented for the first time in 1845, when 14 Jews lived in the city. A Jewish community was not founded there officially until 1855. At that time, Ludwigshafen was home to 107 Jews. Until the end of the 19th century, 1% to 1.5% of the population was Jewish. The well-known philosopher Ernst Simon Bloch was born in Ludwigshafen in 1885. In 1925, the community numbered 1,211 Jews and was the largest in the Palatinate region. The community’s peak membership figure of 1,400 persons in 1931 included many foreign Jewish nationals, mainly from Eastern Europe. Ludwigshafen’s Jews operated two prayer halls (on Ludwigstrasse), an elementary school (from 1856 until 1870) and, after 1857, a municipality-owned cemetery (on Frankenthaler Strasse), which was expanded several times. In 1863/1864, the community purchased a former church on Kaiser Wilhelm Strasse and turned it into a synagogue.  The inauguration ceremony took place in May 1865. The synagogue was renovated numerous times, the last of which was in 1909. In 1925, the Jews of nearby Rheingoenheim were affiliated with the Ludwigshafen community. In 1933, 170 Jewish schoolchildren in Ludwigshafen received religious instruction; the community employed a teacher and a chazzan. A regional center for Jewish welfare was based in the city, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations were active in the community. After Hitler’s rise to power, Jewish officials in Ludwigshafen were removed from their positions, Jewish doctors banned from practicing and Jewish teachers dismissed. The city’s Jewish stores were boycotted on a permanent basis. The Jewish cemetery was desecrated on several occasions in the 1930s. In 1935/36, the process of so-called “aryanization” was intensified. In October 1938, 166 of the city’s German-Polish Jews were expelled and interned in Zbaszyn in today’s Poland. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, SS troops entered the Ludwigshafen synagogue and confiscated its ritual items. They set the synagogue on fire, along with the adjacent community hall. Jewish homes were vandalized, windows smashed and shops looted. Some Jews were beaten up in the street. Men were arrested and sent to Dachau. Children and older women were taken by boat across the river Rhine to Mannheim and told not to come back. They returned two weeks later. After Pogrom Night, a few Ludwigshafen Jews managed to emigrate. In January 1939, only 395 Jews remained in the city. The synagogue site was sold that year. From May 1939 onwards, Jews were forced to live together in so-called “Jews’ houses.” In October 1940, 183 local Jews were deported to Gurs, France. Another eight were deported from Rheingoenheim, and two from Ruchheim. One Jewish woman from Ludwigshafen was transported to Theresienstadt in 1945. At least 239 Ludwigshafen Jews perished in the Shoah. After World War II, the synagogue site was returned to the official Jewish community of Rhineland Pfalz, which sold the building to a publishing house. A memorial plaque was affixed in 1973. That year, the city had 60 Jewish residents.

Thereafter sporadic Jewish settlement continued, but Jews were finally banned from the town in 1573 and did not return to Luebben for another three centuries. A Jewish community, composed largely of textile merchants, was founded in 1853 or in 1857.

In 1656, Polish and Lithuanian Jews fleeing Cossack pogroms were allowed to settle in nearby Moisling, which would become part of Luebeck in 1762. The Jews of Moisling, however, were not allowed to enter Luebeck except for during the brief period in which Luebeck was under French jurisdiction; during that period, in 1812, Luebeck’s first synagogue was inaugurated on St.-Annen-Strasse. In 1821, the city senate issued a decree expelling all Jews, after which most moved to Moisling, where the Danish decree offering them protection was still valid. Moisling, then, had a thriving Jewish community for 200 years, with 500 members, a lifetime appointed rabbi, a synagogue and a school. Finally, on October 19, 1848, in the context of the Revolution, Jews were granted full civil rights. In 1851, Jews in Luebeck built a synagogue at Wahmstrasse, but the house of worship was soon unable to accommodate the growing community. In 1880, a new synagogue was inaugurated on St.-Annen-Strasse; at the time, Dr. Salomon Carlebach, founder of the renowned rabbinic dynasty, was Rabbi of Luebeck. The Luebeck Jews maintained a cemetery at Niendorfer Strasse in Luebeck- Moisling—it was consecrated during the 17th century—a Jewish elementary school (100 pupils in 1837) and, after 1904, a Jewish old-age home at 11 St.-Annen-Strasse. In Luebeck, anti-Jewish measures were implemented immediately after the Nazis’ election victories; these included boycotts of Jewish-owned businesses, the renaming of all street names connected to Jews or Judaism, and the public burning of Jewish books, resulting in considerable Jewish emigration. Nevertheless, Rabbi Winter founded a Jewish elementary school in Luebeck in 1933. Although 293 Jews still lived in Luebeck during the summer of 1938, the synagogue was no longer in use. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938) over 200 SA, SS and Gestapo men looted nearly every Jewish store and apartment in the town. The synagogue was not burned down, for it was adjacent to the “aryan” St.-Annen-Museum and had already been sold to Luebeck’s municipality (in 1939). Nevertheless, the ritual objects and the exterior’s large Star of David were taken as trophies and given to scrap metal dealers. Seventyfive local Jewish men were sent to Sachsenhausen that night. By 1941, 359 Jews had left the city. The remaining 140 Jews were deported to Riga and Theresienstadt; of these, only 11 survived the war. There is a memorial plaque next to the former synagogue and cemetery. Jewish displaced persons—the city was home to a post-war DP camp—founded a new community after the war, but it was dissolved in 1968 as a result of dwindling membership numbers. Today, with the arrival of Jews from the former Soviet Union, Luebeck is once again home to a Jewish community.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, LJG  www.irgun-jeckes.org/?CategoryID=319&ArticleID=1155",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=852,852
Luedinghausen,1807,36 in 1865,22,"The Jewish community of Luedinghausen, established in 1856, served as the central community for all the nearby Jewish settlements (although many maintained their own synagogues and cemeteries) until that arrangement was ended in 1919. In Luedinghausen prayer services were conducted in the Auerbach family home until 1827, when the family joined Jakob Adler in building a proper synagogue (it also housed a schoolroom and an apartment for a teacher). From 1834 until 1836, and again from 1864 until 1873, the community ran an elementary school. In October 1938, shortly before Pogrom Night, the wardens of the synagogue were arrested and its plot of land confiscated. The synagogue was destroyed on November 10, but it was not until 1960 that its ruins were cleared. Those Jews who remained in Luedinghausen after the pogrom were eventually deported, some to Riga in 1941, the others to Theresienstadt in 1942.

Lueneburg,13th century,175 in 1905,,"The earliest record of Lueneburg’s Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”), on which a prayer room was apparently located, is dated 1288. Jews were expelled from Lueneburg in 1348/49, and it was not until 1680 that a new community was founded there. Records also tell us that services were conducted in private prayer rooms until 1894, when local Jews inaugurated a synagogue at 5 Schifferwall. Other communal institutions included a school and a cemetery, the latter of which was consecrated on Am Neuen Felde in 1883 (closed in 1934). In 1933, 114 Jews lived in Lueneburg, served by a chazzan from Hamburg. A teacher from Hamburg instructed nine schoolchildren at the school for religious studies. Active in the community were a Jewish women’s association (1922) and a cemetery foundation, both of which conducted welfare work. In Lueneburg, the anti-Jewish boycott was enforced beginning in March 1933, as a result of which most Jews left. The synagogue was sold in October 1938, presumably after the last service was conducted there (on October 23). It is not clear whether the building was torn down in October of 1938 or on Pogrom Night. We know for certain, however, that members of the SA desecrated the cemetery on Pogrom Night, and that they vandalized and looted Jewish-owned shops. Local Jewish men were sent to Sachsenhausen the next day. In 1943, the remaining Jews were sent to Hamburg, from where they were deported. At least 41 Lueneburg Jews perished in the Shoah. For several years after the war, Lueneburg was home to a displaced persons camp. Several memorials and stumbling stones commemorate the former synagogue, its members and the deportees.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, HU, JGNB1, LJG, SIA, W-G  www.d-friedhof.de/  www.geschichtswerkstatt-lueneburg.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=854,854
Luenen,mid-17th century,140 in 1933 (see below),140,"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Luenen is from the mid-17th century. In 1660, two Jewish families were registered there. Until the early 19th century, those Jews who lived in Luenen were “protected Jews,” namely, a limited number of Jews who had received letters of protection from the local authorities. The French occupation forces lifted this restriction in the 18th century, after which the Jewish population experienced considerable growth. In 1811, the community inaugurated a synagogue at 30, Kirchstrasse, near a Protestant church and the city hall; one of the synagogue’s rooms accommodated the Jewish school, which was recognized as a public school in 1908 but was closed down in 1933. Other communal institutions included a cemetery, consecrated on presentday Muensterstrasse in the late 1600s. We also know that this affluent Jewish community was able to hire permanent teachers for the Jewish school, among them Herz Horn, who held the post from 1822 until 1873. On the eve of the Nazis’ rise to power, Jewish life was flourishing in Luenen. According to records, the community planned to build a new synagogue and school, on Wilhelmstrasse, in 1930. By 1938, 24 Jewish-owned businesses had been liquidated, as a result of which most of the owners emigrated from Germany; in 1939, two Jewish-owned businesses, Luenen’s last, were closed down. On Pogrom Night, local Nazis celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch by ravaging Luenen’s streets, after which they shot two Jews (killing both), drowned another and fatally injured yet another. The synagogue was destroyed; its contents were set on fire in the market square; the rioters did, not, however, succeed in burning down the building. Jewish homes were broken into and destroyed that night, their owners brutally beaten. More than 91 local Jews emigrated from Germany after the pogrom. The municipality bought the synagogue building on March 6, 1939. The cemetery was leveled that same year. By September 1939, the remaining Jews had been moved into two designated “Jews’ houses,” from which they were deported in 1942. According to Yad Vashem, 43 Luenen Jews were killed during the Shoah. Luenen is no longer home to a Jewish community.

Luexheim,probably in the 19th century,,,"Although records reveal very little about the early days of this tiny Jewish community, we do know that between 40 and 50 Jews had settled there by the mid-19th century, constituting 15% of the town’s total population. Jews from Mueddersheim, Noervenich, Hochkirchen and Gladbach were members of the Luexheim synagogue community. According to records, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Nikolaistrasse in 1893. On Pogrom Night, local Nazis destroyed the synagogue’s interior and plundered its inventory, after which they burned down a section of the building. The fate of those Jews who still lived in Luexheim in 1938 remains unknown. Luexheim is no longer home to a Jewish community. The synagogue building has been rebuilt, and now accommodates a carpenter’s shop.

Lyck was home to a publishing house established by Eliezer Lippman Silberman, who, in addition to printing Jewish and Hebrew books and manuscripts, founded a Hebrewlanguage newspaper that was distributed throughout Europe. Many Jewish books were smuggled from Lyck to Russia, where such material was illegal. In 1930, Lyck’s synagogue was vandalized; in 1932, Jewish-owned businesses were attacked. As a result, the German Zionist Organization set up a local office in Lyck. The organization’s efforts to persuade local Jews to immigrate to Palestine were unsuccessful, however, and most Lyck Jews relocated to larger German cities. On Pogrom Night, SA men set fire to and burned down the synagogue.

Maerkisch Friedland,16th century,"1,144 in 1816",70,"In the late 16th century, Jews from Brandenburg were invited to settle in Maerkisch Friedland (today Mirosławiec, Poland) to help develop its economy; a second wave of Jewish arrivals in 1715 helped stimulate the economy further. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Jewish community of Maerkisch Friedland was the largest in Western Pomerania, its 1,053 Jews constituting about half of the town’s population. Maerkisch Friedland was ravaged by fire in 1754; it is not clear whether or not a synagogue existed prior to the blaze, but if so, it was not until fifteen years after the fire that another was built. The Jewish community established a Jewish elementary school in or around 1820 (it was closed in approximately 1880) and a new synagogue in 1840. From in 1830 onwards, however, the Jewish population dwindled. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were the few remaining Jewish-owned stores. In March 1940, Maerkisch Friedland’s remaining Jews were deported.","Fred Gottlieb  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=859,859
Madfeld,early 18th century,82-96 in 1855,26,"In 1704, one Jewish family resided in Madfeld. Jewish population growth was initially modest, so that only 10 Jews lived there in the early 19th century. By the mid-19th century, however, the community had consecrated a cemetery on An der Egge and a synagogue in a private residence, the latter of which burned down in 1855. A new synagogue was built in 1858 (renovated in 1886) and used until April of 1924, when, as a result of financial problems, the community signed over the house of worship to the newly-founded official synagogue association. In 1932/33, at which point the community employed a shochet, four Jewish children received religious instruction. Although the synagogue building was used for storing hay, the Madfeld synagogue association continued to exist until 1940. The former synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, shortly after which its ruins were cleared. Between 1933 and 1942, nine Madfeld Jews emigrated and 10 relocated within Germany. Six were deported in 1942, and at least 21 perished in the Shoah. A new building was later built on the synagogue site (present-day Schuetzenstrasse).

Magdeburg,965,"approximately 2,361 in 1925","approximately 1,973","The earliest record of Jewish settlement in Magdeburg is dated 965. The early Jewish community, the oldest one in the eastern part of Germany, maintained a synagogue (14th century), a yeshiva and a cemetery (13th century). Local Jews lived in the Judendorf (“Jews’ village”) quarter. In Magdeburg, Jews suffered a series of persecutions and expulsions, and it was not until the early 19th century that a new community was established there, after which the Jewish population grew rapidly: from 188 Jews in 1811 to 2,361, the peak, in 1925. The modern Jewish community inaugurated a synagogue at 2c Grosse Schulstrasse (present-day Julius-Bremer- Strasse) in 1851; the 1,000-seat, Liberal synagogue—the architectural style incorporated Moorish features, and we also know that an organ was used during services—was renovated in the late 1890s and reopened in September 1897. Other Jewish institutions included a cemetery at 46 Fermersleber Weg (1816), a school for religious studies (1834) and, next to the synagogue, a community center. Prominent Magdeburg rabbis included Ludwig Philippson, who served the community from 1833 until 1862. In 1933, 1,973 Jews lived in Magdeburg, served by a rabbi, a chazzan and a teacher; 254 schoolchildren received religious instruction in 1932/33. Active in the community were several welfare associations, youth clubs and local branches of national Jewish organizations. Beginning in 1933, anti-Jewish violence and legislation intensified in Magdeburg: that year, guests at a Jewish hotel were attacked; two Jews, members of the Communist Party, were arrested in 1933/34; and a local Jew was sentenced to 10 years’ hard labor in 1935. As a result of the deteriorating situation, many local Jews emigrated. In 1938, all children who had been expelled from German public schools received general schooling at the school for religious studies (see above). Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), members of the SS and the Hitler Youth looted the synagogue and destroyed its interior; the Torah curtain, however, was saved. Other Jewish facilities were demolished that night, Jewish homes and stores were vandalized and 375 Jewish men were arrested, beaten up and taken to Buchenwald concentration camp.In 1939, approximately 700 Jews lived in Magdeburg. Ownership of the synagogue building was transferred to the municipality, which ordered that the building be blown up. In 1940/41, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved to so-called “Jews’ houses”). Approximately 500 were deported to the concentration and annihilation camps in Eastern Europe; of these, most perished in the Shoah. A new community was founded in Magdeburg in 1947, which has been home to a Jewish community center at 1a, Groeperstrasse since 1968. In November 1988, a memorial was erected near the former synagogue; the area around the memorial is now called An der Alten Synagoge (“at the old synagogue”). At the Jewish cemetery on Fermersleber Weg, two memorial stones have been unveiled.

Mainz,900 CE,"approximately 3,500 in 1890","2,780","The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Mainz is dated 900 CE, but it is likely that Jews settled in the area earlier. Mainz, a center of Jewish learning throughout the Middle Ages, was home to many prominent rabbis and scholars, including Rabbeinu Gershom Me’or Hagolah. In 1150, the rabbinates of Speyer, Worms and Mainz created a federation (referred to by the acronym SHUM) to serve as a high court for the Jews of Germany. The Mainz community was not only persecuted, but destroyed on several occasions and expelled on others; the Crusader massacre of 1096 is commemorated in Jewish elegies. Jews were allowed to resettle in Mainz in 1583, after which a community—it was affiliated with Bingen until 1630—began to develop. Mainz Jews lived in a ghetto until 1792. The community of the Middle Ages maintained synagogues and an important yeshiva, but its houses of worship were burned down or confiscated during the aforementioned persecutions. Mainz’s Jewish community opened a small synagogue in 1639 and a larger one in 1673, the latter of which was enlarged and renovated in 1717 and again in 1773 (it was eventually converted into a community center). In 1856, three years after the community inaugurated a new synagogue in which the use of an organ and other reform practices were introduced, Orthodox Jews founded a meeting place for their own congregation on the corner of Flachsmarkt and Margarethenstrasse; renovated in 1879, this synagogue was enlarged to accommodate 300 worshipers. The mainstream community inaugurated a new synagogue on Hindenburgstrasse in 1913, with 580 seats for men and 482 for women. Finally, in 1929, the Orthodox congregation opened another new synagogue. Eastern European Jews conducted services in a prayer hall at 13 Margarethenstrasse (established in the 1880s). The first Orthodox rabbi was Marcus Lehmann, a leader of the German Orthodox separatist movement, who founded and edited its main newspaper, Der Israelit. Mainz-born Ludwig Bamberger was a leader of the 1848 revolution, and one of the main leaders of the German liberals (1823-1899). In 1933, Solomon Levi and Moses Bamberger were rabbis of the mainstream and Orthodox communities, respectively. Several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations were active in Mainz. On Pogrom Night, the mainstream community’s synagogue was burned down. The interior of the Orthodox synagogue was destroyed, but the ensuing fire was extinguished. The Eastern Europeans’ prayer hall was destroyed and looted. Jewish homes and businesses were ransacked, a local Jew was killed, two committed suicide and 60 Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald. The Orthodox synagogue was demolished in 1939/40, after which services took place in the community center (2, Forsterstrasse) until the deportations. Mainz Jews were deported to Poland and Theresienstadt in 1942/1943. Somewhere between 1,300 and 1,400 Mainz Jews perished in the Shoah. The new Jewish community, founded by survivors in October 1945, opened a synagogue in 1947; in 1952, that synagogue was moved to the Forsterstrasse building, which had been returned to the community. The synagogue was renovated and enlarged in 1966, and a government office was built on the site of the mainstream community’s destroyed house of worship.

In 1894, a neighboring building was renovated to house a Jewish school and an apartment for a teacher, who also served as the shochet and chazzan. The community conducted burials in Mingolsheim and Eichtersheim. In 1933, five schoolchildren studied religion in Malsch; a Jewish-owned cigarette factory employed 20 workers that year. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior, furniture and ritual objects were destroyed; Jewish homes, the last two Jewish-owned businesses and other Jewish properties were heavily damaged; all Jewish men were sent to Dachau.

Mannheim,1650,"6,792 in 1925",,"The emerging Jewish community of Mannheim consecrated a cemetery in 1661. (Records indicate that a mikveh existed in the city that year.) By 1662, the Jews of Mannheim had their own synagogue and a rabbi; by 1670, they had built a new synagogue alongside a community center and other Jewish institutions. All were destroyed when the French leveled the city in 1689. The synagogue, however, was rebuilt in 1700 and enlarged in 1767 and again in 1771. In Mannheim, a new Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1840. The famous court Jews, Suess Oppenheimer (nicknamed “Jud Suess”) and Lemle Moses Reingannum (the latter of whom founded a Klaus, or a center for Torah studies, in 1708), lived in Mannheim. Rabbis Jakob Ettlinger and Samson Raphael Hirsch (Ettlinger’s pupil and, later, rabbi of Frankfurt and leader of German Orthodox Judaism) were associated with Mannheim. In the mid-18th century, two other Klaus centers were founded in the city, making Mannheim a center of Jewish learning.  That, combined with the prosperity of several local Jews, explains Mannheim’s nickname as “the new Jerusalem.” In 1851, the community demolished its synagogue, which could no longer accommodate the growing congregation, and began building a new one. The new house of worship, a large and impressive Reform synagogue with an organ, was inaugurated in 1855 and renovated in 1897/99 and again in 1907/08, after which it had a seating capacity of approximately 700. Orthodox Jews conducted services at the Klaus synagogue, which in 1888 was moved to a new building, where there were seats for 128 men and 98 women; the Orthodox synagogue was renovated and enlarged in 1929/30. The community employed a second rabbi in the 20th century; Rabbi Isak Unna held that post for 37 years. Mannheim’s Eastern European Jews maintained their own prayer halls, of which at least four are known to us. The Jews of Mannheim opened a Jewish hospital, one of the first in Germany, in 1711, and a Jewish school in 1816. The school, initially a private institution, received official status in 1819; it was incorporated into a general school in 1870, the same year in which the Klaus opened a religious studies school for young Jews attending mainstream schools. Later, in 1929, a Lehrhaus (a center for adult education) was opened for adults who wished to pursue Jewish studies. Ludwig Frank, a Mannheim Jew who led the Social Democratic faction in the Baden regional parliament, was elected to the German Reichstag (national parliament). He volunteered to serve in World War I, and fell in combat on the third day of the war. Many Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations were active in Mannheim in 1933. Dr. Max Gruenwald and Dr. Unna Klaus served the community that year. Jewish children were expelled from their public schools in 1934, after which they were allocated two classrooms in a local school building. A yeshiva was nevertheless opened in the Klaus synagogue that same year and, in 1935, the community established a Jewish elementary school. In 1938, the community was forced to sell its cemetery to the municipality; the remains of those buried there were disinterred and buried in a mass grave in the new cemetery. In October 1938, at least 75 local Polish Jews were expelled to Poland. One month later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue and the cemetery’s purification house were blown up; Nazis looted the synagogue’s interior and stole its ritual objects. The interior of the Klaus synagogue—the Torah scrolls were burned on the street—was destroyed, as was the Eastern European Linas Hazedeck prayer hall, the last remaining Eastern European hall in the city. Jewish businesses and homes were attacked, and property was ransacked, looted and, in some cases, set on fire. In Mannheim, the looting and destruction continued even after Goebbels ordered a stop to the pogrom. All Jewish men under 60 were deported to Dachau, where several died. After the pogrom, many Palatinate Jews escaped to Mannheim: the Jewish hospital housed 350 of these refugees, and prayer services were held in shifts at the renovated Klaus synagogue. Approximately 3,927 Mannheim Jews emigrated; 485 died in the city; 40 committed suicide; 67 either died in custody or were executed, and 1,984 were deported to Gurs, in France, on October 22, 1940. After the deportation, several hundred Jews (most were elderly, sick or married to ethnic Germans) remained in Mannheim, of whom the able-bodied were subjected to forced labor. The hospital building was confiscated in December 1941, and the school was closed in the summer of 1942. Patients from the hospital were moved to the old-age home, and when that, too, was seized (in 1943), to private homes. In 1941/42, three more transports of Jews left Mannheim for Izbica (Poland), Theresienstadt and Auschwitz; in February 1945, another transport left for Theresienstadt. In total, 2,375 Jews were deported from Mannheim. Approximately 1,300 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue’s ruins, damaged during an aerial bombing in 1943, were cleared in 1955/56; in 1962/63, a combined commercial and residential building was built on the site, to which a memorial plaque was affixed in 1964. The Klaus synagogue, appropriated by the municipality after the deportation to Gurs, was used as a storage site until it, too, was damaged by an aerial bombing in 1944; the ruins were cleared in 1953 and later rebuilt. A memorial plaque was affixed to a nearby church in 2000, and a memorial stone was unveiled at the new cemetery in 1953. In 2003, the town unveiled a monument. The new Jewish community of Mannheim was founded in 1945. A new synagogue and community center were opened in 1957; in 1987, yet another synagogue and community center were established in the city.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, IGML, PK-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=867,867
Marburg,Middle Ages,512 in 1900,341,"The modern Jewish community of Marburg emerged in the 17th century. By 1900, most local Jews were peddlers, merchants or bankers; the town was also home to a Jewish-owned hotel and a restaurant. Marburg became the seat of the provincial rabbinate in 1823. In 1818, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Ritterstrasse, replacing an older prayer room. Later, in 1897, a larger synagogue was inaugurated on Universitaetsstrasse, offering 230 seats for men and 175 for women. Burials were conducted in a medieval cemetery (renovated in the mid-1800s) on present-day Alter Kirchhainer Weg. The community also maintained a charitable association, a women’s organization, an association of Jewish academics, a mikveh and a school, the last of which was, at times, presided over by two teachers—one who served as chazzan, and the other as assistant and shochet. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, after which the site was appropriated by the local university. We do not know how many Jews left Marburg after Pogrom Night, but records do tell us that 23 local Jews were deported to Riga in 1941, and that 54 were sent to Theresienstadt in 1942. Eighteen Jewish patients at the local mental institution were murdered. At least 95 Jews from Marburg perished in the Shoah. A new Jewish community developed in Marburg in the 1980s. The cemetery was re-consecrated, and the ruins of the medieval synagogue were unearthed in the 1990s. The former synagogue site—excavations commenced in 2008— was converted into a park and memorial.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH.

Mardorf,1603,47 in 1885,27,"It was during the 19th century that the Jewish community of Mardorf experienced gradual growth. Local Jews, most of whom were traders of cattle, fruit or other produce, maintained a synagogue, a school for religious studies and a mikveh, all three of which also served the adjacent Jewish communities. Services were conducted in private residences until the 1860s, when the community purchased a barn (it was located in the center of town) and converted it into a synagogue sanctuary with seats for 38 men and 28 women. We also know that the community’s teacher served as chazzan and shochet. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 prompted all those who could do so to abandon their businesses and flee, so that by 1938 there were only 14 Jews left to witness the destruction of the synagogue, whose windows and interior were, respectively, smashed and gutted by members of the local SA. The building, however, was not set on fire, and was eventually transferred to private ownership, after which it reverted to its former use as a barn. Those few Jews who did not manage to flee Mardorf perished in the camps. One Jewish family returned to Mardorf: Ilse Flachmann, her husband (whom she met in the camps) and her father, Israel Heinemann (a decorated war hero from World War I). They eventually moved to Marburg and died there.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: AJ, DJGH",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=869,869
Marienburg,1815,337 in 1871,,"Jewish families settled in Marienburg in 1814/15, shortly after which they formed a community. The town’s Jewish population increased during the second half of the 19th century, peaking at 337 in 1871. The Jews of Marienburg consecrated a synagogue and a cemetery in 1830. Later, in 1897/98, the community built a new synagogue on Schulgasse (or “school alley” – school meaning “synagogue”); it was inaugurated in August 1898. A local Jew was appointed to the city council in 1864. Other prominent Marienburg Jews include Heinz Galinski (born in 1912), a Marienburg native who served as the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany from 1988 to 1992. We also know that the Association of East Prussian Communities, an organization that aided Eastern European Jews, opened an office in Marienburg in the early 20th century. In 1932/33, Marienburg was home to 170 Jews; 18 schoolchildren received religious instruction from a teacher who also served as chazzan. Active in the community were a Jewish women’s association (founded in 1926), a nursing association, a burial society, a youth group, a literature club, and, finally, a local branch of the Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night (November 1938). By May of that year, only 33 Jews still lived in Marienburg. According to records, 31 local Jews were murdered in the Shoah.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn Sources: EJL, FJG, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=870,870
Marienwerder,1789 (one family),290 in 1890,186,"A Jewish banker, Leib Jacob Lewin, moved to Marienwerder (present-day Kwidzyn, Poland) in 1790. More Jews settled there during the ensuing decades, but they were forced to pay exorbitant taxes, protection money and, after each wedding or birth, to make special donations to the royal coffer. It was not until 1815 that the town authorities permitted the Jewish community to consecrate a cemetery. The Jewish population peaked in the second half of the 19th century. Most Marienwerder Jews were merchants, but several large stores and prominent businesses were owned by Jews. Services were conducted in a small prayer hall until 1832, when the community—Jews living in the surrounding villages were members—inaugurated a new synagogue. A century later, a larger synagogue was built in Marienwerder. During the years 1845 to 1850, Dr. Heimann Jolovicz, the local rabbi, attempted unsuccessfully to introduce the congregation to the Reform liturgy. Many Marienwerder Jews either left for larger cities or emigrated from Germany during the 1920s and 1930s. On Pogrom Night, SA men burned down the synagogue and destroyed the Jewish cemetery. Members of at least 25 local Jewish families perished in the Shoah.","Fred Gottlieb  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=871,871
Markoebel,1632,91 in 1885,46,"The modern Jewish community of Markoebel began to grow in the early 19th century. Most local Jews were cattle dealers or merchants of textiles and agricultural products; later, some Jews opened retail shops in the area, maintaining mostly good relations with the Christian townsfolk. Markoebel Jews initially worshiped in a private house. By 1830, however, they had established a synagogue with a mikveh, classrooms and seats for 38 men and 18 women. The community employed teachers of religion who also functioned as cantors and, in most cases, as ritual slaughterers. As a result of the deteriorating economic climate, the town’s Jewish population diminished during the early 1900s, so that by 1924 only eight Jewish children were receiving religious instruction. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 encouraged those who could to flee Germany; others sought anonymity in larger German cities. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was destroyed by SA men from nearby towns; private residences were vandalized, and Jewish homeowners were arrested and mistreated. All Jews had left the town by 1939, but at least 21 Markoebel Jews were deported to the death camps from other locations. The only relic of the former community is the cemetery, where approximately 50 tombstones are still intact.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=872,872
Markt Berolzheim,1631,174 in 1812,65,"In the early 1700s, after a fire destroyed the Berolzheim synagogue, the Jews of Markt Berolzheim built a new house of worship at 15, Marktplatz. Although the community was able to maintain its own mikveh and school (the latter closed down in 1924), Jewish burials took place in Treuchtlingen. In 1933, 11 schoolchildren studied religion in Markt Berolzheim. Two welfare organizations (a chevra kadisha and a Chevra Gemilus Chassodim) and several charitable societies (including the Bernhard and Hanna Bermann Foundation for Brides) were active in Markt Berolzheim. In 1933, Nazis humiliated a local Jew in public; and in 1936, laborers attacked Jews at the train station. On Pogrom Night, SA troops and local residents set the synagogue on fire, destroyed Jewish homes and attacked Jews. Twenty-one Jews were arrested and imprisoned in Gunzenhausen; they were released, but none returned to Markt Berolzheim. The day after Pogrom Night, one of the village’s three remaining Jews was deported to Nuremberg; by December of 1938, the other two were living in Karlsruhe. Between 1934 and 1938, 23 Markt Berolzheim Jews emigrated and 18 relocated within Germany. At least 37 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

This synagogue housed a mikveh and a school for religious studies, the latter of which became a Jewish elementary school in 1920. Marktbreit’s Jews buried their dead in Roedelsee. In 1933, 20 children attended the school. Several Jewish associations were still active in Marktbreit that year. On Pogrom Night, local residents vandalized 11 Jewish homes. The following morning, the mayor and other town officials prevented the SS from setting fire to the synagogue. Instead, the SS men destroyed the synagogue’s interior, ritual objects and Torah scrolls. Jews were assembled in the marketplace, where they were humiliated by local residents; six of the men were deported to Dachau and Buchenwald. After the pogrom, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into several designated houses; according to records, they were later moved to the Jewish community center. Between 1933 and 1942, 54 Jews moved to Marktbreit, 135 either emigrated from or relocated within Germany, and eight died in the town. Thirty-two were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) and to Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 88 Marktbreit Jews perished in the Shoah.

Jews returned to Mayen in the 18th century and founded a regional community in 1849. Services were conducted in prayer rooms, the last of which was located on Keutelstrasse, until 1855, when the community inaugurated a synagogue on Im Entenpfuhl; in 1902, the women’s gallery was enlarged. The community also maintained a Jewish elementary school, (founded in 1860, the school became a public institution in 1878) whose teacher performed the duties of chazzan; a second chazzan served as the community’s shochet. Mayen’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in the 17th century—its oldest surviving gravestone is dated 1640—and was desecrated in 1890. In 1933, 225 Jews lived in Mayen. Thirty-four children attended the Jewish school, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations were active in the community.

The cemetery was restored after 1945, and in 2004 Al Gruen of Chicago funded the construction of a Shoah memorial in Mellrichstadt.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=885,885
Melsungen,1532,188 in 1880,76 (12 in affiliated Roehrenfurt in 1932),"The Jewish community of Melsungen was founded in the second half of the 18th century. The synagogue on Muehlenstrasse (possibly Fritzlarer Strasse), used until 1836, accommodated a prayer room, a teacher’s apartment and a school. Between 1836 and 1841, during the period of construction of the new synagogue, a temporary prayer room and a schoolroom were established in the homes of Benjamin Abt and Solomon Abt’s widow, respectively. The new synagogue at 13 Rotenburger Strasse—the foundation stone is dated 1841—accommodated a schoolroom, a teacher’s apartment, a mikveh, 89 seats for men and, on the balcony, 58 seats for women. Melsungen was home to a Jewish elementary school from 1854 until 1924. Burials were conducted in Binsfoert until 1860, when the community consecrated its own cemetery. In 1931/32, seven Jewish children received religious instruction in Melsungen. Active in the community were a Jewish sisterhood, a brotherhood, a synagogue choir and a sewing club. Twenty-three local Jews emigrated after 1933: nine went to the United States, three to South Africa, three to England, three to Belgium, two to the Netherlands and three to Palestine. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue and other Jewishowned properties were demolished. Jews were assaulted— one injured woman lay on the street for half the night until she was rescued by a local innkeeper—and several men were sent to Buchenwald, where one of them died on November 20, 1938. By 1939, the Jewish population had dropped to 26. In September 1939, the community was forced to sell the synagogue to the Nazis for a paltry sum; the Nazis refused to pay, at which point the synagogue was sold to a craftsmen’s guild. Twenty-five local Jews emigrated, 17 relocated to other towns and cities in Germany and 10 were deported. At least 46 Melsungen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1945, the municipality was forced to pay compensation for damages inflicted during the Shoah. The synagogue, now a commercial building, bears a memorial plaque. In 2008 and again in 2009, memorial stumbling stones were unveiled in Melsungen.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL  www.stolpersteine-melsungen.de/index.php?id=412",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=886,886
Memmelsdorf,16th century,240 in 1813 (almost half of the total population),25,"The Memmelsdorf synagogue at 4 Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley”—one of the oldest synagogues in Lower Franconia to be restored after World War II—dates back to 1728 (the building also housed a mikveh). The community established a Jewish elementary school (on Schlossstrasse) in 1819 and a cemetery in 1835, prior to which Memmelsdorf Jews used the cemetery in Ebern. The school, which was moved to 3 Judengasse in 1896, closed down in 1912 as a result of dwindling enrollment numbers. Anti-Jewish riots took place in the village in 1923; and in 1926, the cemetery was desecrated. We also know that in 1933, only three children studied religion in Memmelsdorf. In May 1938, the community began negotiating the sale of the synagogue building. Later that year, on Pogrom Night, SA men forced the male members of the community to burn the synagogue’s Judaica in a field. In August 1939, the synagogue was sold to the municipality. Memmelsdorf ’s remaining Jews left in February 1940. Seventeen local Jews perished in the Shoah. An association of patrons and friends of the Memmelsdorf synagogue, founded in 1993, arranged the purchase and restoration of the synagogue building, the latter of which was completed in the summer of 2004.

Other communal institutions included a Jewish cemetery (1875), a mikveh (1875) and a new synagogue (1909), the last of which seated 200 worshipers. Twenty-seven schoolchildren studied religion in Memmingen in 1933. On Pogrom Night, explosives were used to demolish the synagogue. Jewish homes and businesses were destroyed, a Jewish woman was beaten and 18 Jews were arrested, some of whom were deported to Dachau. The violence continued for six days, after which the community was billed for the damage. In 1941, the remaining 40 Jews were forcibly moved into two apartments. Sixty-seven Jews emigrated and 37 relocated within Germany. In 1942, most of the remaining Jews were deported, via Fellheim, to the Milbertshofen camp. Later that year, 22 local Jews were deported to Piaski; another 12, at least, were deported to Theresienstadt. The last three Jews, all of whom were married to Christians, were deported to Theresienstadt in February 1945. At least 88 Memmingen Jews perished in the Shoah. The cemetery was later restored.

Mendig,"1663, peak Jewish population",,approximately 78 (see below),"The first available record of a Jewish presence in Mendig, a decree dated 1663, granted Jews the right to access willow trees from the forest. Local Jews initially conducted services in a private residence in Niedermendig (Lower Mendig). Inaugurated in 1886, the community’s synagogue in Niedermendig served the Jews of both Nieder and Obermendig (Upper Mendig). Although Mendig Jews were never able to establish their own school, they did maintain a cemetery just outside of Niedermendig. Community members, most of whom were (at least until the 20th century) strictly observant Jews, attended the synagogue daily, bought kosher meat in Thuer and educated their children in religion: local Jewish children were able to study religion at the Jewish school in nearby Thuer or with private tutors. In 1933, approximately 39 Jews (13 families) lived in Niedermendig. The population figure for 1936, which applies to all of Mendig, is 78. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, after which the ruins were demolished. Most Mendig Jews emigrated during the following months and years; those who stayed behind were eventually deported. In late July 1942, Mendig was declared “Judenrein” (cleansed of Jews). According to Yad Vashem, 25 Mendig Jews were killed in the Shoah. Mendig is no longer home to a Jewish community. A memorial plaque, erected next to the former synagogue site, commemorates the destroyed community.

In Menden, a Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Am Bromberken in 1837. During the years 1861 to 1878, five local Jews were elected to the town council. In 1932/33, 43 Jews lived in Menden; 11 schoolchildren received religions instruction. Later, on Pogrom Night, SA men and local civilians damaged the synagogue’s door and windows, threw Torah scrolls onto the street, burned down part of the interior and desecrated the cemetery. The synagogue building was renovated as a furniture shop in May 1939. In all, 13 Jews left Menden. Thirteen were deported in April and July of 1942, and at least 17 local Jews died in the Shoah. The former synagogue building was torn down in 1952; at the site, which now accommodates a new building, a plaque commemorates the synagogue and a memorial stone commemorates Menden’s Jewish deportees.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, SG-NRW, SIA, YV  Birkmann, Guenter/ Stratmann, Hartmut: Bedenke vor wem du stehst.

The first teacher was hired in 1816, and we also know that Meppen was home to a Jewish school from the year 1851 until (approximately) 1921. Records from 1896 and 1901 mention a Talmud Torah school; after 1860, the community ran a Jewish sisterhood. By November 1938, 26 Jews had left town, seven of whom emigrated from Germany. On November 10, 1938, at four in the morning, an SA leader received orders to burn down the synagogue and arrest the remaining Jewish men, who were then interned in Sachsenhausen (one was sent to Buchenwald). Before being sent to Sachsenhausen, one of the men managed to save a Torah shield from the ashes; he brought it with him when he immigrated to California, where it is now on display in a synagogue. At least 12 Meppen Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial stone was placed near the synagogue site—it now accommodates a residential building—in 1996.

Merzhausen,17th century (five families by 1646),75 in 1861 (10.6% of the total pop.),,"By 1833, the Jewish community of Merzhausen had established a synagogue in a half-timbered building at 10, Dorfstrasse (present-day 30, Ziegenhainer Strasse); the nearby Jewish school accommodated a teacher’s apartment and a mikveh. Although the school was closed in 1878, when only four children studied there—25 were enrolled in 1868— it was reopened for 20 students in 1886. Merzhausen’s Jewish school was presided over by a teacher who served as chazzan and shochet. The community, which belonged to the district rabbinate in Marburg, consecrated a cemetery in 1858. By 1933, the Jews of Willingshausen (five Jewish families in 1933) and Schrecksbach (one family) had been affiliated with the community in Merzhausen. The synagogue community, many members of which were textile merchants, maintained a welfare society and a brotherhood. The last leader of the community was Avraham Plaut. Several Merzhausen Jews immigrated to the United States and to Palestine after 1933; others relocated within Germany. The synagogue was plundered in 1938, after which the building was appropriated by a nearby farmer who later (in 1947 or 1951) tore it down. In 1939, only nine Jews lived in Merzhausen. On May 31, 1942, the remaining two Jews were deported to a concentration camp. At least 22 Merzhausen Jews, 10 from Willingshausen and two from Schrecksbach perished in the Shoah. The former Jewish school is now a residential building. Heavily damaged during the Nazi period, the cemetery was reconstructed after the war. During the 1990s, Theo Plaut tried in vain to erect a memorial at or near the former synagogue site.

We also know that, in 1810, after decades of burying its dead in Berlichingen, Bodigheim and Huengheim, the Merchingen community consecrated a cemetery on the road to Ballenberg. In 1933, by which point the Jews of Osterburken had been affiliated with the community, nine schoolchildren studied religion in Merchingen. A Jewish charity was active there that year. On Pogrom Night, chazzan Heymann Bravmann and his wife were assaulted in their apartment; the synagogue’s interior was destroyed. Later, in 1940, the building was sold to the municipality, after which it was converted into a sports hall. Twenty-two Merchingen Jews emigrated, nine relocated within Germany, five died in Merchingen and three were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 29 Merchingen Jews perished in the Shoah. Of the six Osterburken Jews, five emigrated and one died in 1938. Although the cemetery was accidentally bombed in an air raid in 1945, much of it still exists.

The town was home to a Jewish cemetery (consecrated before 1748 and enlarged in 1904 and again in 1910) and, after 1842, to a synagogue on the corner of Rehstrasse and Neustrasse. Merzig Jews maintained a Jewish school from 1823 until 1876, after which the community employed a teacher of religion, who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, approximately 200 Jews still lived in Merzig. Seventeen children studied religion that year, and nine Jewish associations were active in the community, with which the Jews of Brotdorf and Hilbringen were affiliated. Most Jews left Merzig after the Saarland region was returned to the German Reich in March 1935. Accordingly, the community was disbanded in 1937. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire, Jewish-owned homes and businesses were vandalized and the cemetery was largely destroyed. The synagogue building was subsequently repaired and used by the municipality until 1944, when the building was destroyed during an air raid. On October 22, 1940, at least seven Merzig Jews were deported to Gurs, France. At least 44 local Jews perished during the Shoah.

Minden’s new synagogue, built near the site of the destroyed house of worship, contains a memorial bearing the names of all Shoah victims from Minden. An additional memorial was unveiled in front of the city hall.

Mittelsinn,17th century,162 in 1867 (15.7% of the total population),105,"This community gave up its synagogue on Brunnenstrasse in 1867, after a storm damaged the building. In 1871, a new synagogue was established at 14 Fellenbergstrasse, just two doors down from the Jewish community center (at 12 Fellenbergstrasse), which contained rooms for the Jewish school and living quarters for the schoolteacher. Although the school was closed in 1924 as a result of insufficient enrollment, it was reopened in 1931. The community maintained its own mikveh, but buried its dead in Altengronau (in Hesse). Germany’s annexation of Austria in March 1938 sparked riots motivated by anti-Semitism in Mittelsinn: Jewish businesses were broken into, windows were smashed and the synagogue was damaged, after which approximately 70 Jews fled. On Pogrom Night, the interiors of the synagogue and of the community center were destroyed, as were the ritual objects. One Jewish home was looted that night. Eight-one Jews left Mittelsinn in 1938, and seven fled in 1939; of these, most relocated within Germany (seven emigrated). By April 1939, no Jews remained in Mittelsinn. At least 68 Mittelsinn Jews perished in the Shoah. Sections of the synagogue and school’s walls survived the war. The community center was later renovated, and a memorial plaque was unveiled opposite the former synagogue site.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, IAJGS, JGEN, PK BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=904,904
Moenchengladbach,1337,"1,439 in 1905","907 or 1,200","Moenchengladbach’s 14th-century Jewish community was destroyed during the Black Death pogroms of 1349, when local Jews were either murdered or forced to flee. It was not until 1621 that a new Jewish community was established in the town. In 1856, Moenchengladbach became the center of a synagogue association; after 1870, its congregation was the largest in the region. Among the town’s notable Jewish residents was Avraham Gotthelf, who, in 1855, opened the city’s first weaving mill. The regional congregation was dissolved in 1890, after which the Moenchengladbach-Rheydt congregation was formed, together with a few independent satellite communities. Local Jews conducted services in prayer halls—all were located in private residences—until September 14-16, 1883, when a new synagogue was inaugurated on Karlstrasse (present-day 15-17 Bluechenstrasse). The synagogue housed a Jewish elementary school, and we also know that the community maintained a cemetery at Huegelstrasse after 1840 (near an older cemetery at an unknown location). The Huegelstrasse cemetery still exists. The Jewish population in 1933 was either 907 or 1,200 (sources of information differ), constituting 0.6% of the city’s total population. In 1933, a branch of the Maccabi sports club was opened in Moenchengladbach, with 60 members. Jewish stores were boycotted after 1933, and in July 1935, Jews were banned from public swimming pools (earlier than in the rest of Germany). On Pogrom Night, SA men set fire to the synagogue and its Torah scrolls; the fire department attempted to extinguish the blaze, but was prevented from doing so by the SA. Jewish homes and stores were also destroyed, and more than 50 Jewish men were sent to Dachau. In May of 1939, only 375 Jews still lived in Moenchengladbach. After 1941, Jews were deported to the ghettos in Lodz, Riga, Izbica, Lublin and Theresienstadt. Of the 638 deported Jews, only 27 survived the Shoah. A memorial plaque was later unveiled opposite the former synagogue site. The new Jewish community was established after the war, numbering 100 members in 1960 and 270 in 1993. In April 1967, the community established a prayer hall at Albertusstrasse.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=905,905
Moenchsroth,1593,194 in 1811/12 (22.9% of the total population),23,"In 1761, the community inaugurated a synagogue at presentday 1 Rathausstrasse; the building contained a schoolroom and an apartment for the teacher. The mikveh, initially located in the cellar of the synagogue, was later moved to an outbuilding. Local Jews maintained an elementary school from 1826 until 1890, after which a teacher instructed Jewish children in religion. Burials were conducted in Schopfloch. In 1933, the 23 Jews of Moenchsroth maintained a chevra kadisha and a women’s association. By August 1938, most of the village’s Jews had left; accordingly, the community was dissolved. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and furniture were destroyed; the building itself, which was about to be sold to the mayor, was not burned down. That same night, the town’s four remaining Jewish homes were ransacked, and all four Jews (three of whom were women) were detained at the prison in Feuchtwangen. Eight Moenchsroth Jews emigrated and 16 relocated within Germany. The remaining Jews left in January 1939; at least 27 Moenchsroth Jews perished in the Shoah. In later years, the former synagogue was used as gymnasium, as a town hall and as a warehouse. In 1988, a geniza, or storeroom for holy books, (the second-largest to be discovered in Franconia) was discovered under the floorboards of the attic. A memorial stone was unveiled near the synagogue in 2006.

Moerfelden-Walldorf,1611,80 in 1861,unknown,"Records from 1806 mention Yitzhak ben Aharon, a teacher of religious studies. Community member Moshe Katz began fundraising for the construction of a synagogue in 1816; inaugurated in 1829, the synagogue was located on Kalbsgasse. Burials were conducted in two older cemeteries until 1841, when new burial grounds were consecrated in Gross-Gerau. Community membership— Moerfelden-Walldorf belonged to the Orthodox rabbinate in Darmstadt—began to decline after 1861. In 1933, the Agudat Chovevei Hatevi club was shut down. Later, in 1935, members of the Hitler Youth heavily damaged the synagogue. Three Moerfelden-Walldorf Jews emigrated in 1936; one local Jewish woman committed suicide. On Pogrom Night, Simon Goldschmidt’s shack was burned down, windows in Jewish homes were broken and two Jewish men—Max Strauss and Adolf Reiss—were sent to a concentration camp. Although the synagogue had been sold in 1937, the building was nonetheless ravaged on Pogrom Night. In 1938, three local Jews immigrated to South Africa, one to England and one to Luxemburg. Others relocated within Germany, mainly to Frankfurt am Main. On May 17, 1939, 16 Jews still lived in Moerfelden, of whom three (Erna Strauss and her two children, Ruth and Kurt) managed to immigrate to New York on January 6, 1941. In 1941, the 13 remaining Jews were forcibly moved into Simon Schott’s home at 9 Mittelgasse. Schott, the 72-yearold community chairman, hanged himself in his shack on March 5, 1942. Two weeks later, on March 20, 1942, the remaining Jews were deported to the death camps. Ten were sent to Poland, and two were deported from Walldorf to Theresienstadt in September 1942. In 1947, a local sports association unveiled a memorial stone to the Jewish community at the cemetery. At the initiative of the German Communist Party, a memorial stone was unveiled at the former synagogue site.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: IAJGS, PK-HNF www.synagoge-pfungstadt.de/ www.synagoge-heubach.de www.moerfelden-walldorf.de www.fjgk.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=907,907

In 1933, two children studied religion with a teacher from Selters. (According to records, the community was able to employ a teacher in the late 1800s.) On the morning after Pogrom Night, the village’s Jews were locked in the school house as axe-wielding SS men in civilian clothing destroyed the synagogue’s interior, Jewish homes and Jewish-owned properties; neighboring residents, concerned for the safety of their own homes, prevented the SS from setting fire to the synagogue. Eight Jews left Mogendorf before Pogrom Night, and the rest fled soon afterwards, the last leaving in 1939. At least eight local Jews perished in the Shoah. Wartime aerial bombings further damaged the synagogue. In 1952, a local Evangelical church acquired the building.

Inaugurated on April 19, 1858, Momberg’s synagogue was located at 58 Haus, the site of a former barn. Records from 1825 tell us that the community’s mikveh was then located in the home of one Michael Spier. Notable Jewish-owned businesses included a kosher noodle factory, a matzo factory and a kosher slaughterhouse. Five Momberg Jews died fighting for Germany in World War I. As a result of the Nazis’ anti-Jewish boycott and other repressive measures, 13 local Jews immigrated to the United States during the 1930s; one Jewish family immigrated to South Africa. Rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects on Pogrom Night (November 1938), after which the damaged building was sold to farmer who converted it into a barn. Most Jews left the town after the pogrom; in 1941/42, the remaining 11 Jews were deported. According to Yad Vashem, 22 Momberg Jews were killed in the Shoah.

According to other documents, however, the history of Jewish Mondorf began in the 18th century. The community established a synagogue in the early 19th century. In 1862, a new synagogue—it included a women’s gallery—was built on Provinzialstrasse; Jews from the neighboring towns (including Rheidt) also attended services there. Mondorf’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1883. In 1932/33, 20 Jews lived in Mondorf. A shochet served the community, and three schoolchildren received religious instruction. Later, on Pogrom Night, SA men from Wuppertal and local residents destroyed the synagogue’s door, windows and furniture, after which they set the building on fire. Four Jews from Mondorf and Rheidt were arrested on Pogrom Night and released several weeks later. Few local Jews managed to emigrate. Most were deported in 1942; 19 perished in the Shoah.

Montabaur,1338,117 in 1905,82,"The earliest records of a Jewish presence in Montabaur refer to the anti-Jewish persecutions of 1338 and 1348/49. It is quite possible that individual Jews lived in Montabaur in the 15th and 16th centuries, but it was not until the 17th century that an organized community emerged there. Montabaur Jews had established a synagogue by 1691; founded a prayer room in the mid- 18th century; a new synagogue, at 5 Wallstrasse, in 1889 (renovated in 1930); and a cemetery in 1910. We also know that the community maintained a school and a mikveh. In 1933, a teacher/chazzan instructed nine children in religion. A women’s group and a youth association were active in the community, with which the Jews of Wirges were affiliated. The synagogue was broken into on the night of November 3, 1938; some ritual objects were destroyed that night, and others were stolen. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior, assaulted local Jews and wrecked Jewish-owned homes and businesses. A Jewish man and his daughter committed suicide, another Jew died trying to escape, and others were marched to the town hall and beaten. Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald. Forty-one Montabaur Jews emigrated while others relocated within Germany. In August 1941, the town’s remaining eight Jews were deported to a camp in Friedrichssegen-Lahn; of these, four died in Friedrichssegen-Lahn and four were deported to Poland in September 1942. At least 26 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was demolished in the 1940s, but a memorial plaque was later unveiled at the site.

Mosbach’s first honorary citizen was Rabbi Dr. Leopold Loewenstein (1843-1924). Loewenstein not only organized religious and charitable activities, but also wrote important works on Baden’s Jewish history. In 1933, Julius Grailshamer was district rabbi; a teacher/chazzan instructed 15 schoolchildren in religion. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), Jewish homes and the two remaining Jewishowned stores were vandalized. The synagogue was set on fire, but not before the rioters had destroyed its interior and (this was done at the marketplace) burned the ritual objects and Torah scrolls. The cemetery was heavily damaged that night, and eight Jews were sent to Dachau. One hundred and ten Jews left Mosbach, two died there, and 16 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940.

Muehlhausen,13th century,196 in 1881,204,"Records indicate that Jews lived in Muehlhausen in the 13th century. The medieval community, which maintained both a synagogue and cemetery, was expelled in 1561. Jews resettled in Muehlhausen during the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1841, the modern community, founded in 1806, inaugurated a new synagogue—it housed a mikveh, a school, a library and a rabbi’s apartment—at 24 Juedenstrasse (“Jews’ street”). A new cemetery was consecrated on Eisenacher Strasse in 1872. In 1933, 204 Jews lived in Muehlhausen. A teacher, who also served as shochet, instructed 31 schoolchildren in religion. Three Jewish charity associations were active in the town: a humanitarian society (founded in 1875), an Israelite women’s association (founded in 1839) and a Chebrah Gemillus Chessed (founded in or around 1900). In response to anti-Semitic incitement, which included a show trial in the town against racial defilement, many Jews left Muehlhausen. On Pogrom Night, a Nazi official and his drinking companions desecrated the cemetery, destroyed the synagogue’s interior and looted Jewish homes and establishments; the community teacher was shot, and two elderly women were physically assaulted (they died soon afterwards). Thirty-one Jewish men were arrested and brought to a local gym, from which they were sent, on November 11, to Buchenwald, where two died. In 1940/41, the town’s remaining Jews were confined to a designated “Jews’ house” in the synagogue’s front building. By 1943, following deportations the year before, Muehlhausen was declared Judenfrei (free of Jews). At least 66 Muehlhausen Jews perished in the Shoah. Renovated in the 1990s, the synagogue is now a monument and cultural center.

After the founding of the community, local Jews established a prayer room in a private residence on Pfarrgasse. Although the community never employed a rabbi (served, instead, by the rabbi of Offenbach), it did maintain its own Jewish school and a cemetery, the latter of which was consecrated at An der Leuschnerstrasse in 1893. The Nazis’ anti-Jewish boycott, implemented in 1933, was only partially successful in Muehlheim, for most of the town’s residents were still associated with the Social Democrats. Beginning in 1935, however, as a result of the deteriorating political climate, many local Jews emigrated. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was wrecked and set on fire. Jewish men were locked inside the guardhouse of a local Catholic church and were abused by SA men, after which some were deported to Buchenwald. The remaining Jews held their last synagogue service in January 1939; the damaged building was subsequently sold to a private buyer who used the site as a storage facility. Available Jewish population figures for Muehlheim are as follows: 56 in 1938, 40 in 1939 and 16 in 1940.

The towns of Muelheim and nearby Kaerlich belonged to the Archbishopric of Trier, which for centuries placed restrictions on Jewish population growth in the area. It was only in 1863, in fact, that a Jewish community was officially founded in Muelheim. Services were conducted in a prayer hall in a private residence on Bassenheimer Strasse until 1925, when the community sold the building and built a small synagogue on the site. We also know that the Jews of Muelheim maintained a cemetery on Hoorweiher Strasse/Lohrweg (established in or around the year 1850) and employed a teacher of religion who performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, 13 children received religious instruction. The following Jewish population figures are available for Kaerlich: five in 1784, 24 in 1895 and 20 in 1925. There, too, Jews established a prayer hall in a private residence (on Burgstrasse). On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior, set the building on fire and mockingly paraded its Star of David through the village; in Kaerlich, windows in Jewish homes were smashed. After the pogrom, Kaerlich’s local council appropriated the house in which the prayer hall had been located. Forty-one Jews from Muelheim, Kaerlich and nearby Urmitz-Bahnhof were deported in 1942.

Muelheim an der Ruhr,1620,664 in 1920,448 or 517,"During the 17th century, under the protection of the Broich duchy, a few Jewish families were allowed to live in Muelheim an der Ruhr and work as traders, butchers or moneylenders. The congregation established a prayer hall near the Petri church in the mid-18th century; and in 1792, the same year in which the community drew up its first charter, a synagogue was inaugurated on the corner of Notweg and Jackenstrasse (it was enlarged on several occasions). Muelheim’s Jewish school, opened in an adjoining building in or around the year 1820, was recognized as an official elementary school at some point between 1861 and 1875. The Jewish congregation received official independent status in 1855. Burial grounds were acquired in or around 1720; the cemetery, which was expanded on three different occasions, is still in use. In order to accommodate the growing congregation, for whom the synagogue’s 150 seats were no longer sufficient, the community consecrated a new synagogue (on Viktoriaplatz) on August 2, 1907; the neo-Romantic building accommodated 300 men, 250 women (separate entrances were used), a mikveh, several assembly rooms and a smaller synagogue for weekday services. Active in the community were a sisterhood, other charity organizations, a youth movement, a sports club and a literature club. Many Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe settled in Muelheim, some of whom formed a separate cultural association and a prayer room in nearby Oberhausen (on Marktstrasse). In 1932, as anti-Jewish violence escalated in Muelheim, the Jewish cemetery was desecrated. Jews were denied entrance to public places, doctors were banned from medical associations and lawyers were forced to give up their cases. Arthur Kaufman, an influential Muelheimer artist who in the 1920s served as the first director of the School for Decorative Art, was dismissed from his post. The synagogue was sold four weeks before Pogrom Night, for the community was unable to continue its maintenance. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior—including its furniture, books and Torah scrolls—was destroyed, as were Jewish-owned stores and homes. Muelheim’s fire brigade burned down the synagogue building the following morning. Those Jews who were not arrested on Pogrom Night were forcibly moved into “ghetto houses” in the city center, after which they were used as forced laborers. Approximately 290 local Jews were deported to the camps in Eastern Europe, where at least 266 perished. According to records, 50 local Jews committed suicide during the Nazi period. The town’s new Jewish congregation, founded in cooperation with Jews in Duisburg in 1955, inaugurated  a new synagogue on Kampstrasse in 1960.

Muencheberg,1734,55 in 1880,40 or 45,"We know little about this community’s history before 1840, when the regional congregation of Muencheberg was formed. Records do tell us, however, that the cemetery at Tempelbergweg was consecrated in 1756. The community employed a teacher and a community official, and religious gatherings took place in the home of Isaac Bendix. Although the Jews of Muencheberg had applied for permission to build a synagogue in 1847, construction was completed only in 1856. The final product, a synagogue on Hinterstrasse, seated 60 congregants. By 1854, all Jewish children attended the congregation’s elementary school. Two more villages had joined the regional congregation a year earlier, but membership nevertheless started to decline around this time. Jewish properties were destroyed on Pogrom Night: homes were wrecked, the synagogue was burned down and men were arrested and deported to the East. Many local Jews subsequently left for Berlin. Three Muencheberg Jews are known to have survived the war; 30 perished in the camps.

Muenden,1520,155 in 1875,84,"In Muenden, a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1673, proof that this community developed earlier than did most others in the area. Initially, Muenden Jews earned a modest living as dry goods merchants, second-hand clothes dealers and lottery ticket sellers. During the 19th century, however (professional restrictions on Jews were lifted in 1814), local Jews branched out into manufacturing and other industries. The community inaugurated a new synagogue in 1834; and in 1878, after the synagogue was damaged during a fire, the building was renovated and re-consecrated. Muenden’s Jewish elementary school, founded in 1831, was presided over by a series of teachers: Simon Mauer, the first, served for 35 years; in 1925, teacher Theodor Wertheimer celebrated 30 years of service. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 unleashed a wave of panic among the seemingly secure Jewish citizens of Muenden, causing many to either emigrate from or relocate within Germany. In 1935, when all large Jewish-owned businesses were “aryanized,” more Jews fled Muenden. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was vandalized—ritual objects were burned in the street—windows in Jewish apartments were smashed and house owners were arrested. Forty-two Jews, Muenden’s last, were deported in 1942. Years later, on the 50th anniversary of Pogrom Night, a memorial plaque was unveiled at city hall.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: JGNB, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=922,922
Muenster,mid- 17th century,82 in 1840,17,"This community of cattle dealers, butchers and textile merchants existed for a comparatively short time. Seventy-seven Jews lived in Muenster in 1829, but it was shortly after the community recorded its peak membership figure (in 1840) that many Jews began to leave in search of better economic opportunities in larger communities and in the United States. Local Jews worshipped in a prayer hall that had been set up in the attic of Leopold Simon’s home. The community, which was affiliated with the Orthodox rabbinate in Darmstadt, conducted burials in nearby Dieburg. Owing to the fact that many Jews had left Muenster in the early 20th century, the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 had little impact on the community. Pogrom Night, however, had a disastrous effect on those still there: the prayer hall was overrun by local Nazis (the house was later destroyed), the homes of the remaining Jews were destroyed and the men were arrested, abused and sent to Buchenwald. Those few Jews who still lived in Muenster in 1942 were deported to Auschwitz and murdered there. In 1997, a memorial plaque was unveiled at a local school.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=923,923
Muenstermaifeld,13th century (perhaps earlier),68 in 1885,60,"Jews were persecuted in Muenstermaifeld in 1287, 1337 and 1348/49. Although individual Jews settled there throughout the ensuing centuries—records from 1409 mention a synagogue and a Jewish school—it was only during the 19th century that the community experienced real growth. In 1868, a regional Jewish cemetery was consecrated on a plot of land belonging to the nearby village of Mertloch. The modern community inaugurated a synagogue and hired a teacher of religious studies in 1887 and 1901, respectively. Four schoolchildren received religious instruction in 1933; later, in 1936, five children studied under the guidance of a local Jewish woman. A charity association and a minyan association were active in the community in 1933. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. The aforementioned charitable society, which was jointly run by the Jews of Muenstermaifeld and those in nearby Polch, was still active in 1940. By 1941, however, most Muenstermaifeld Jews had left. Three local Jews died in Dachau, two died in Muenstermaifeld in 1941/42 and 15 were deported to the East in 1942 (seven of them on July 27 of that year).

Muenstereifel,14th century,133 in 1868,65,"The Jews of Muenstereifel were recognized as a fully independent community in 1919, prior to which (after 1847), as a semi-independent community, Muenstereifel had been part of the regional Jewish community of Rheinbach. Records from 1468 tell us that the Jews of Muenstereifel conducted burials in the regional cemetery. In 1660, a prayer hall was established at 17, Orchheimerstrasse. Much later, in 1877, a local Jew purchased that house and demanded rent from those who frequented the prayer hall; most refused to pay, and a new prayer hall was opened at 41 Stumpfgasse. In 1880, however, the community purchased the Orchheimerstrasse house and established a synagogue there: the building accommodated 36 seats for men, 29 for women, a Jewish school and a teacher’s apartment. Two ritual baths existed in private residences. We also know that the community maintained a Jewish school intermittently between 1824 and 1875, after which a teacher of religion—he also served as chazzan and shochet— instructed children in religion. Muenstereifel’s modern Jewish cemetery, officially consecrated in 1823, was enlarged in 1876 and again in 1930. In 1933, five schoolchildren received religious instruction. Two chevra kadisha organizations (one for men, the other for women) were active in the community, with which the Jews of Arloff and Kirspenich were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the Muenstereifel synagogue was destroyed. Jewish homes and businesses were vandalized, the cemetery was desecrated and one Jew was assaulted. The synagogue building was sold in 1939. Fifteen Muenstereifel Jews emigrated and others relocated within Germany. The 15 Jews who still lived there in 1941  were sent to a nearby camp from which they were deported to the East in 1942. At least 57 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

Muenzenberg,1188,138 in 1861 (14% of the total population),27 or 28,"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Muenzenberg, dated 1188, mentions a blood libel accusation. During the Third Crusade (1189-92), however, Jews from the surrounding cities—namely Mainz, Worms and Speyer— found refuge in Muenzenberg. Records indicate that the medieval Jewish community was on good terms with the authorities. The medieval community maintained a synagogue, but its location is unknown. Prominent Muenzenberg Jews included Rabbi David ben Kalonymus (David of Muenzenberg), an important 13th-century Jewish scholar. It was during the 13th century, too, that local Jews were granted residential rights. In Muenzenberg, whose Jewish community was well-regarded, Jews at one point made up one-third of the town’s total population. The modern community inaugurated a new synagogue at 14 Mittelgasse (present-day 14 Am Junkernhof and Pfarrgasse) in 1848. Other communal institutions included a mikveh, a Jewish school and a cemetery, the last of which was located at Steinberg-Gelaende. In 1933, the Nazi Party launched its anti-Jewish boycott. Local Jews faced not only economic persecution, but also relentless harassment by the SA. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters plundered Jewish-owned stores and set the synagogue’s interior on fire. On September 25, 1942, the town’s remaining 11 Jews were deported. According to Yad Vashem, 21 Muenzenberg Jews were killed in the Shoah. Muenzenberg is no longer home to a Jewish community.

Munich - Introduction (München / Muenchen),13th century,"11,083 in 1910","9,005","The Middle Ages  While we cannot be certain about the exact origins of Munich’s medieval Jewish community, a document from 1229 refers to the presence of a Jew in the city. Jews lived in a designated Jewish quarter and apparently maintained a synagogue, a mikveh and a cemetery. The medieval community was wiped out by a series of pogroms in 1285, 1345, 1349, 1413 and 1442.  The 18th Century until the Rise of Hitler  Although a small community was reestablished in the late 17th century, it was expelled in 1715. During the years that followed, a number of court Jews were allowed to settle in Munich, among them Wolf Wertheimer and Aron Elias Seligmann. More Jewish families moved to Munich in the 1780s, and by 1798 the Jewish community numbered 216 members. A rabbi was appointed and a rabbinate established in 1802.  The legal status of the community improved during the Napoleonic era: in 1805, Jews were granted permission to worship in public, live in all parts of the city, sell craft work and trade in certain goods. The decree of 1813, which permitted Bavarian Jews to establish new communities, triggered the establishment of an independent Israelite congregation in 1815 and of a synagogue on Theaterstrasse (later named Westenrieder Strasse) in 1826. An elementary school, which also offered religious tuition and was founded by Abraham Wolfsheimer, operated from 1842 until 1872. The community built a cemetery on Thalkirchner Strasse in 1816 (enlarged in 1854, 1871 and again in 1881); in 1908, this was replaced by a new cemetery on Garchinger Strasse. Prior to 1816, Jews were buried in Kriegshaber, near Augsburg.  The growing Jewish population (4,144 in 1880) triggered the construction, in 1887, of an impressive synagogue at 7 Herzog Max Strasse. Then the third largest synagogue in Germany, it was intended to be the central synagogue of the entire community. But in 1873, in response to the introduction of religious reforms and the steady development of the Reform movement (under the leadership of Rabbi Dr. Josef Perles), the Orthodox faction founded the Ohel Jakob Association and inaugurated, in 1892, their own synagogue on Kanalstrasse (later called Herzog Rudolf Strasse). Eastern European Jews prayed at Kanalstrasse and in several other locations (Klenzestrasse, Ickstattstrasse and Hans Sachs Strasse). Later, in 1931, two Eastern European religious organizations, the Linath Hazedek and the Agudath Achim, inaugurated an Orthodox synagogue on Reichenbachstrasse. Jews greatly contributed to Munich’s fame as a cultural and artistic hub. Prominent Jewish personalities included the art dealer Lehmann Bernheimer, the gallery owner David Heinemann, the conductor Hermann Levi, the poet Karl Wolfskehl and the businessman Hermann Tietz, the last of whom founded the famous Hertie department store chain in 1888. Local Jews were also prominent in industry and trade.  The Nazi Era  Munich, a Nazi stronghold during the Weimar Republic, was the birthplace of the Nazi Party (in 1920). Jewish students were attacked at the university, and Jewish candidates for teaching positions were rejected on racial grounds. After the Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923, Jews were assaulted in public. One hundred and eighty Eastern European Jewish families were expelled from the city. In 1930, Munich became the national headquarters of the Nazi Party. Nevertheless, Munich’s Jewish community numbered more than 9,000 members in 1933, and continued to offer an array of religious and cultural opportunities. A Jewish public school, established in 1924, had an enrollment of 132 children in 1932/33; a Talmud Torah school enrolled 793 students that same year. The community also maintained a variety of social services, including an old-age home, summer camps, children’s homes and kindergartens, welfare organizations, employment agencies and vocational schools. Cultural associations were active in Munich, as were branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations. The community’s outstanding library included an extensive collection of Hebrew manuscripts. Under Nazi rule, Jews were persecuted and rapidly deprived of their rights. Anti-Jewish boycotts were aggressively enforced by the SA and Hitler Youth: businesses were “aryanized,” Jews were arrested and sent to Dachau and, in June/July of 1938, the central synagogue on Herzog Max Strasse was demolished on Hitler’s orders. Fifty Jews were indicted on charges of racial defilement. Goebbels’ famous anti-Semitic speech, held in Munich on November 9, 1938, triggered Pogrom Night. In Munich alone, synagogues, prayer rooms, the Jewish library and other facilities were destroyed. Jewish homes and businesses were damaged and looted, and store windows were smashed. Approximately 1, 000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to Dachau. In May 1939, all Polish Jews were expelled from the city. Between 1933 and 1938, a total of 3,574 Jews left Munich. Another 803 died in the city. By the fall of 1941, local Jews had been evicted from approximately 1,500 apartments. Often subjected to forced labor, many were forced to build the Milbertshofen Ghetto, about four miles from Munich. Four hundred and fifty Jews were sent to live there in 1941, and the ghetto also served as a transit camp. Three hundred Munich Jews were brought to the Berg-am-Leim Ghetto. Between November 1941 and February 1945, 42 transports deported 2,991 Munich Jews to Riga, Piaski, Auschwitz and Theresienstadt. At least 2,804 local Jews perished in the Shoah.  After World War II  A new Jewish community was founded in Munich in July 1945, and the reconstructed synagogue on Reichenbachstrasse opened for services in 1947. (It was Munich’s central synagogue until 2006). As a result of the immigration to Germany of Eastern European Jews during the 1990s, the community grew to about 11,000 members (in 2006). In 2006/07, a new synagogue building, community center and Jewish museum were opened on Jakobsplatz. Three memorial stones commemorate the destroyed community: the first, unveiled in 1969, stands on the site of the old central synagogue; the second commemorates the Ohel Jakob Synagogue; and the third memorializes those who suffered at the Milbertshofen transit camp.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, EJL, FJG, GJ, LJG, SIA, PK-BAV  www.rijo.homepage.t-online.de/pdf/en_de_ju_sky40200.pdf",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=927,927
Mutterstadt,1719,91 in 1933,,"The modern Jewish community of Mutterstadt established its first synagogue in 1838. In 1905, a new synagogue, which also housed a mikveh and a laundry, was inaugurated at 24 Oggersheimer Strasse (formerly Rheinstrasse). The synagogue had windows on which scenes from ancient Jewish history were painted. Local Jews buried their dead in Wachenheim until 1822, after which burials were conducted in Fussgoenheim. In 1890, however, the community consecrated its own Jewish cemetery. Ninety-one Jews lived in Mutterstadt in 1933. That same year, 10 schoolchildren received religious instruction from a teacher/chazzan. On Pogrom Night, SA men burned down the Mutterstadt synagogue and destroyed Jewish-owned homes and businesses; Jewish men were sent to Dachau, and the community was disbanded not long after the pogrom. By 1940, 48 Mutterstadt Jews had emigrated from Germany. Those who remained were forcibly moved into a few Jewish-owned houses, from which, in February 1940, the able-bodied were taken for forced agricultural labor. On October 22, 1940, 52 Mutterstadt Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least 75 local Jews were deported to the East, of whom 57 perished in the Shoah.

Nalbach and Diefflen Jews conducted services in in prayer rooms, located in in private residences, until 1854, when a synagogue was inaugurated in Nalbach (at 17 Mittelstrasse). Although the synagogue burned down in 1890, it was rebuilt soon afterwards and renovated in 1922. During the 19th century, the community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Many Jews left Nalbach after the Saarland was returned to the German Reich in March 1935. The synagogue was sold in 1937, after which a section of the building was demolished. On Pogrom Night, Jews were dragged from their homes and beaten, Jewish homes were plundered and what remained of the synagogue’s interior was demolished. On October 22, 1940, the remaining Jews were deported to Gurs. At least 21 former Jewish residents of Nalbach and Diefflen perished in the Shoah.

Communal institutions included a cemetery (1794) and a synagogue (1856), and we also know that local Jews held, for a period, a monopoly on the region’s production of alcoholic spirits. The community recorded its peak membership figure in 1871, soon after which, mainly as a result of younger Jews leaving for larger towns and cities, the Jewish population began to dwindle. Only 50 Jews still lived in Namslau in 1930, by which point they were being terrorized by Nazi hoodlums and subjected to discriminatory legislation. A local Jew was attacked that year, and the cemetery was vandalized. The synagogue and several Jewish-owned businesses were destroyed on Pogrom Night.

After 1700, Jews conducted services in a small payer room; in 1800, a synagogue was inaugurated on Potsdamer Strasse (present-day 11 Goethe Strasse). The community, which had its own chazzan, shochet and teacher, used Berlin’s Jewish cemetery until 1819, when a cemetery was consecrated on Am Weinberg.

Jewish burials were conducted in Plathe until 1817, when the Jews of Naugard finally consecrated their own cemetery on Hinterburger Landstrasse. Although we do not know when the Jewish congregation was officially formed, records do tell us that in 1865/66, the community inaugurated a synagogue on the corner of Schuhstrasse and Toepferstrasse.

Between 1793 and 1795, the community built a new synagogue on Gerichtstrasse (present-day 9 Graf-Volkwin- Strasse); in 1844, the building was enlarged to accommodate a school (it housed an apartment for the teacher) and a mikveh, both of which were moved to the synagogue from other locations. Naumburg’s synagogue had a seating capacity of 67 (40 men, 27 women), additional seating for guests and an impressive array of brass lighting fixtures.

Later deemed unsafe, the building was demolished, after which, in 1889, a new synagogue was opened at the same location. The community maintained a mikveh and, until 1925, a Jewish school, whose teacher also served as chazzan and shochet. Burials took place in Hirschhorn. In 1937, only 13 Jews lived in Neckarsteinach.

Neckarbischofsheim,17th century,202 in 1859,37,"From the mid-18th century until 1824, Neckarbischofsheim was the seat of the district rabbinate. The community established a mikveh by 1648, a synagogue in 1746 and another synagogue in 1769. The synagogue on Schulgasse, meaning “school (or synagogue) alley,” inaugurated in 1849, accommodated 150 to 200 men and 100 women; because the building stood on swampy land, it was supported by pillars. Neckarbischofsheim’s Jewish school, opened in 1849, was closed in 1876, as were all confessional schools in Baden. We also know that burials were conducted in Waibstadt. In 1933, 37 Jews lived in Neckarbischofsheim. A chevra kadisha and a women’s association were active in the community, and a teacher—he also served as the chazzan and shochet—instructed three schoolchildren in religion. A Jewish physician was director of the town’s hospital. Neckarbischofsheim’s synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, as were its 14 Torah scrolls. The school was destroyed, and both buildings were demolished shortly after the pogrom. All Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Four Jews moved to Neckarbischofsheim after 1933; two Jewish babies were born there during this period. Twentyfive local Jews emigrated, four died in the town and 14 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 29 Neckarbischofsheim Jews died in the Shoah. In 1981, a menorah and plaque were unveiled at the synagogue site.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL, PK BW  www.neckarbischofsheim.de",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=941,941
Neckarzimmern,1534,74 in 1832,29,"This community conducted services in a rented prayer hall in Schmidsbrunnen during the 18th century. In 1824, a building on Hauptstrasse was inaugurated as the community’s first synagogue; and in 1873 the dilapidated synagogue was pulled down and replaced with a new, one-story house of worship which housed a mikveh and a schoolroom. Burials were conducted in Heinsheim. Twenty-nine Jews lived in Neckarzimmern in 1933; a teacher from Heinsheim instructed one child in religion. The community had sold the synagogue to a local family before Pogrom Night, but the building was nevertheless broken into and ransacked that night: ritual objects were thrown onto the street, and Jews were forced to load them onto wagons, after which the items were set on fire. The synagogue building burned down almost completely. Eleven Jews emigrated, one relocated within Germany, two died in Neckarzimmern and 14 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. A Jewish woman who was married to a Christian survived the war in Neckarzimmern. At least twelve Neckarzimmern Jews perished in the Shoah. After World War II, the synagogue was converted into a residential building. As of this writing, the town has not erected a memorial plaque; therefore a passerby would never know that the building was once a synagogue.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL, PK BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=943,943
Neheim,17th century,103 in 1910,62,"The earliest reference to a Jewish presence in Neheim is dated 1651. The community conducted services in prayer rooms until 1876, when a synagogue was inaugurated on Mendener Strasse. Local Jews established a school in 1819 and a cemetery (near the Moehne-River) in 1835. The community—many members of which were businessmen and industrialists—was part of the Arnsberg regional congregation in 1854/55. Five Jewish children received religious instruction in 1933, and a Jewish women’s auxiliary association (founded in 1931) was active in the town. Later, in 1938, Jewish youths were expelled from the high school and forbidden to attend public dances. Between 1935 and 1939, 18 local Jews emigrated from Germany. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s ritual objects, Torah scrolls and furniture. Neheim’s last Jewishowned shop was closed in December 1938. By 1941, the remaining Jews had been moved into a single house, from which they were collected for forced labor and, in 1943, deportation. At least 85 Jews from Neheim and nearby Huesten perished in the Shoah. Yad Vashem’s records for Neheim include the Jewish populations of Neheim, Huesten, and Neheim-Huesten, making it difficult to determine how many of the deceased were actually from Neheim. Used as a storage site after 1945, the synagogue was renovated in the 1980s and, in 1982, declared a listed monument. A plaque has been affixed to the building, which is now owned by a local association.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, HU, SG-NRW, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=944,944
Huesten/Neheim-Huesten,mid-17th century,unknown,50 or 112 (sources of information differ),"Although records do not tell us when this community reached its peak membership number, we do know that the Jewish population figures for 1801 and 1925 were 37 and 87, respectively. Records from 1801 mention a school, but it was not until 1825 that the Huesten community hired a teacher. Local Jews conducted services in a private residence during the mid-19th century. A synagogue—women sat in a designated gallery— was inaugurated on Marktstrasse in 1905. According to records, the Jewish cemetery, which had been consecrated in Alt Huesten (on the corner of Mittelstrasse and Josefstrasse) before 1857, was desecrated in 1924. On Pogrom Night, SA troops destroyed the synagogue and vandalized Jewish homes and stores. One month later, in December 1938, the remaining Jewish-owned shops were shut down. Between 1939 and 1941, a local branch of the German Red Cross used the synagogue building as its headquarters. Local Jews were taken to a quarantine camp in March 1941, and were deported in May 1942. At least 85 Neheim-Huesten Jews perished in the Shoah. (Yad Vashem’s record of the death toll for Neheim-Huesten includes Jews from Neheim, Huesten and Neheim-Huesten, making it difficult to determine how many of the deceased were actually from Neheim-Huesten.)

Neidenburg,unknown,141 in 1871,125,"The Jewish community of Neidenburg (Polish: Nidzica) developed in the second half of the 18th century. Neidenburg was the birthplace of Baruch Hirsch (Bethel Henry) Strausberg, the famous “Railroad King.” In 1933, 20 Jewish-owned businesses were forcibly shut down. By 1938, only 61 Jews lived in Niedenburg, 38 of whom required financial assistance from welfare organizations. The synagogue was abandoned by the end of October. On Pogrom Night, SA men burned down the synagogue building, killed two Jews (Julius Naftali and Minna Zack) and injured several others. In nearby Soldau (Polish: Dzaldowo), patients at a special home for invalids were euthanized. The Soldau synagogue survived Pogrom Night, after which it was used as a cinema. Ruins from the Neidenburg synagogue were later used in the construction of the Grenzland Museum. In May 1939, 23 Jews lived in the Neidenburg region. Several Jews who had moved to Berlin were deported from there. Most of Neidenburg’s German population fled after the Red Army arrived in the town in 1945; those who stayed were victims of terrible atrocities. After the remaining Germans were expelled, the town was renamed Nidzica (instead of Nibork, its traditional Polish name). At least 83 former Jewish residents of Neidenburg perished in the Shoah.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: EJL, LJG, ZA  www.vomhaff.de",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=946,946
Neidenstein,17th century,281 in 1842,63,"Community records from 1796 mention a synagogue. In 1831, a new synagogue, one of the largest in rural Baden, was dedicated at Kirchgraben; it was renovated thoroughly in 1930 in preparation for its centennial anniversary. Neidenstein’s Jewish school (1828-1876) was presided over by a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. Although the community was able to maintain its own mikveh, it used the cemetery in Waibstadt. In 1933, a teacher from Hoffenheim instructed three schoolchildren in religion. A chevra kadisha, a Jewish women’s organization and the Lob-Kunkel charity fund were active in Neidenstein. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was demolished, as was its roof; ritual objects, 14 Torah scrolls, books and numerous pieces of furniture were stolen. Five Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Thirty-three Jews emigrated, four relocated within Germany, six died in the town and 19 were sent to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 37 Neidenstein Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1939, the damaged synagogue was sold to a local farmer who demolished it and used the ruins to build a stable.

Neisse,1350,464 in 1861,220,"According to records, Neisse was home to a Jewish cemetery by 1350 and to a synagogue by 1410. Jews were expelled from Neisse in 1468, and it was only in 1834 that a new community and synagogue (with a classroom) were established in the town. Beginning in the 1860s, however, not long after reaching its peak population, the community started to dwindle as more and more Jews left for the bigger cities. Neisse Jews enjoyed a wide array of social and cultural institutions throughout the 1920s. The Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers was active in the community, as were several Zionist youth movements and the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith. With the rise of National Socialism, Zionist activities were intensified and classes in Hebrew were organized. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were Jewish communal buildings and Jewish-owned homes and businesses, after which all Jews who were able to left the country.

Nentershausen,17th century,149 in 1861 (14.4% of the total population),nine families,"In 1810, the Jewish community of Nentershausen established a synagogue on Unter den Linden. The community also maintained a schoolroom, a mikveh—located in the “shepherd’s house” near the synagogue after 1885/86—and a cemetery, the last of which must have been consecrated in the mid-19th century, for its oldest grave, a child’s grave, is dated 1849. Hesekiel Freudenberg of Abterode served as teacher until 1869, as did Max Mendel Katz, from 1884 until 1934, when he moved to Frankfurt. By 1933 the Jewish communities of Solz (two Jews lived there in 1933) and Imshausen (one Jewish family) had been affiliated with the Nentershausen community; Solz had been affiliated since 1900. The community maintained a chevra kadisha and a sisterhood, and although the elementary school had been closed by 1932, three children received religious instruction that year. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was destroyed, Jews were assaulted and private property was damaged. (Today the United States Holocaust Museum houses the synagogue’s damaged Torah Ark.) In 1939, the synagogue was sold to a private buyer for the paltry sum of 600 Reichsmarks. Willi Katz immigrated to Ecuador and another community member, Bacharachs, moved to Lower Silesia. In 1942, the remaining Jews were deported, via Kassel, to the East. At least 55 Nentershausen Jews perished in the Shoah. Joseph Abraham, of Solz, perished in Theresienstadt on September 24, 1942. The synagogue was later used as a storehouse, a workshop and a shed. Eventually restored, it was opened to the public in 1996. In 2001, the Jewish cemetery was desecrated—28 headstones were overturned—by four youths from Bad Hersfeld.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, JVL  www.geschichtsverein-rotenburg.de/  home.arcor.de/christenjuden/presse/HNA_Erinnern.pdf",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=949,949

The community maintained its own school and mikveh, but buried its dead in Huettenheim. In 1933, two schoolchildren studied religion in Nenzenheim. A branch of a Zionist organization was active in the community. On Pogrom Night, Nenzenheim’s synagogue was set on fire; the flames consumed the building’s interior, the ritual objects and the Torah scrolls. All Jews were imprisoned until evening time in a community-owned building. During the Nazi period, eight Nenzenheim Jews immigrated to the United States, five immigrated to Palestine and 12 relocated in Germany. Of the four who remained in the village, two were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in April 1942; and two were deported to Auschwitz (via Fuerth) in June 1943. At least eight Jewish residents of Nenzenheim perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was later converted into a residence.

Neu Isenburg,1830 or 1836,174 in 1921,64 (see below),"In Neu Isenburg, a town founded by Huguenots in 1700, a Jewish presence was first recorded either in 1830 or in 1836. The community never established its own communal institutions, using instead the synagogue and cemetery in nearby Sprendlingen. The community did, however, hold its own prayer services in a room in its training school and orphanage for unwed mothers and homeless girls. Established by the German League of Jewish women, whose founder, Bertha Pappenheim, lived in Neu Isenburg, the school housed hundreds of women during the 1920s, boosting the Jewish population figure for Neu Isenburg. In all, 1,133 Jewish women and children found refuge there during the years 1907 to 1932. The population figure of 64 for 1933, therefore, does not include the students and orphans at the training school. Most Jews had left Neu Isenburg by 1933. Thirty Jewish families lived in neighboring Sprendlingen that year. Later, on Pogrom Night (November, 1938), the synagogue in Sprendlingen was burned down, as was the training school in Neu Isenburg, with the prayer room inside. Eighty-three Jews still lived in Neu Isenburg in May 1939. The orphans from the training school were eventually sent to England, but most of the other Jews—62, according to Yad Vashem—perished in the Shoah. Neu Isenburg is no longer home to a Jewish community. The Bertha Pappenheim House, a memorial site, commemorates the school and its founder. Bertha Pappenheim (1859-1936), a pioneer in social work, was also Sigmund Freud’s first patient (he referred to her as Anna O); she died on May 28, 1936, after being interrogated by the Gestapo.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, EJL, SG-H, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=952,952
Netra with Datterode,,,,"Netra  The Jewish community of Netra built a synagogue (at 19, Brauhausstrasse) in the early 19th century. Netra was home to a Jewish elementary school until 1924, after which a school for religious studies was established there. We do not know when the community consecrated its first cemetery, but records do tell us that a new cemetery was consecrated in the mid-19th century, and that the first burial was conducted there in 1855. Netra Jews maintained their own mikveh. Between 1933 and 1938, the Jewish population dropped from 22 to six (most Jews relocated to Eschwege). By October 1938, only six Jews still lived in Netra: community chairman Solly Rothschild (a furrier) and his wife and daughter (Frieda and Liesel, respectively); and Moritz Katz (a cattle dealer) and his wife and daughter. On Pogrom Night, Katz was cruelly beaten and sent to Buchenwald, where he perished on November 17, 1938. The synagogue building—its windows had been broken on Pogrom Night—was later used a barn and stable. Records suggest that the Jews remaining Netra by the end of 1939, and certainly the Rothschild family, were later murdered. At least 30 Netra Jews perished in the Shoah. Torn down in the early 1970s, the synagogue was replaced by a garage.   Datterode  During its peak years, the Jewish community of Datterode was affiliated with Reichensachsen; in 1884/85, Datterode Jews joined the nearby Netra community. In Datterode, Jews maintained a prayer room in building referred to as the Judenschule (“Jews’ school’)—it housed a prayer room and, possibly, a school. Several Datterode Jews emigrated after 1933, several relocated within Germany, and two (they were husband and wife) passed away in 1937 and early 1938, respectively.

Neuenhaus,1685,47 in 1895,unknown,"This town is referred to in different sources as either Neuenhaus or Veldhausen/Neuenhaus. Today, Veldhausen is a district of Neuenhaus. Although the Jewish community of Neuenhaus built a synagogue on Klinkhamerstrasse during the years 1847 to 1858, it was not until 1913 that a synagogue community was formed in cooperation with the smaller Jewish communities of Uelsen, Veldhausen and Emlichheim. In 1856, the community established a school in Nordhorn; later, in 1896, a Jewish school was finally opened in Neuenhaus. Records tell us that a cemetery was consecrated in Neuenhaus in the 17th century, but the earliest known burial was conducted there in 1769. Neuenhaus belonged to the provincial rabbinate in Emden. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was ransacked, Jewishowned businesses and homes were vandalized and Jewish men were deported to Sachsenhausen, where they were interned for several weeks. The following day, a Christian woman arrived at the local Nazi headquarters and protested the outrage by surrendering the medal her mother had been given after the death of her son in World War I. It was not until after Pogrom Night that Jews began to leave Neuenhaus in large numbers; some of them fled to the Netherlands. The remaining Jews were eventually moved into the Reis family home. On July 7, 1942, a member of the Reis family passed away; and on July 29, 1942, the others were deported, most likely to Theresienstadt—none survived.

Finally, in 1800, the village elders allowed Jews to settle permanently in the town, on condition that they pay a head tax for each Jew; the tax was levied on every individual as well as on his/her belongings. It was not until 1860 that local Jews were permitted to establish an official community, build a synagogue and consecrate a cemetery. The community’s first synagogue was small, but a larger house of worship was built in 1876 and inaugurated in 1877. Neubrandenburg Jews also founded and maintained a school. Beginning in 1937, when anti-Semitism became rampant in Neubrandenburg, Jews started to leave the town in large numbers, so that only 15 Jews lived there by 1938. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was ransacked and set on fire; the arch above the entrance to the cemetery was also torched.

A new Jewish community was later established in Neuhof, with which the Jewish communities of Neustadt, Ellers and Opperz had been affiliated by 1905. Neuhof Jews conducted services in a prayer hall until 1876, when the community dedicated a synagogue on Frankfurter Strasse; the building accommodated 26 seats for men, 16 for women, a school, a mikveh and an apartment for a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. (After 1921, religious instruction was provided by a teacher from Flieden.) In 1905, prior to which burials were conducted in Fulda, the Jewish communities of Neuhof and Flieden consecrated a cemetery. In 1933, only one child received religious instruction in Flieden. A Jewish man and his Christian girlfriend were publicly humiliated in September of that year. The interior of the synagogue was ravaged on Pogrom Night; furniture that had been stored there by a community member was thrown from the women’s gallery. Several Jewish men were arrested by the SA and sent to Buchenwald, and we also know that the community leader, Max Katz, was murdered. The SA appropriated the synagogue building after Pogrom Night. Eighteen Jews emigrated, 12 relocated within Germany, one passed away in Neuhof and 17 were deported to the East. At least 32 Neuhof Jews perished in the Shoah.

Local Jews were engaged mostly in trade—at first in cattle and horses, later in general merchandise. Several young Jewish men died fighting for Germany in World War I, and records also tell us that Neukirchen Jews were active in their town’s communal and charitable endeavors. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 was the signal for Jewish residents to leave town: some managed to emigrate, and others sought anonymity in larger towns (they were, of course, later caught). The synagogue building had been sold before Pogrom Night, but the mob nevertheless wrecked its interior and burned the remaining contents, including Torah scrolls, in the marketplace.

Records indicate that the town was home to a Jewish prayer room in the 17th century, but the earliest record of an actual synagogue (on Bogenstrasse) is dated 1828; a new synagogue was built at 234, Bogenstrasse in 1872, after which the old house of worship served as lodgings for the community’s teacher. Other communal institutions included a mikveh and an elementary school, the latter of which was opened in 1892. We also know that Neumagen hosted Landjudentage (provincial Jewish conventions) during the years 1717 to 1787. In 1909, vandals smashed the synagogue’s windows. That same year, as a result of dwindling membership numbers, the community merged with that of Niederemmel. Seventy-four Jews lived in Neumagen-Niederemmel in 1933; two children received religious instruction. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), when no more than 20 Jews lived in Neumagen, SA men ransacked Jewish homes, destroyed the synagogue’s interior—valuable documents about neighboring communities were lost in the destruction—and stole Torah scrolls and other valuables.

Neunkirchen,1776,234 in 1925,211,"The Jewish community of Neunkirchen established its communal institutions during the 19th century: a cemetery in 1831 (enlarged in 1880); a community center with a prayer room in 1847; a synagogue, built on the ruins of a Renaissance castle, in 1865 (renovated in 1921/22); and a school, presided over by a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet, at some point during the 19th century. In 1933, a total 211 Jews lived in Neunkirchen and in the affiliated communities of Elversberg, Spiesen, Schiffweiler and Wiebelskirchen. A chevra kadisha, a Jewish women’s association and a youth group were active in the community. Most Jews left Neunkirchen after the Saarland was returned to the German Reich in March 1935. Local Jews were assaulted and arrested on Pogrom Night, and the synagogue was burned down. Cleared in 1939, the synagogue site was sold to the municipality in 1942. Neunkirchen’s Jewish cemetery, desecrated in 1938/39, was later bought by a local brewer. One hundred and ten Neunkirchen Jews emigrated; 59 relocated within Germany; and seven, the last, were deported to Gurs, France, on October 22, 1940, and to the Drancy camp, also in France, in February 1944. At least 60 Neunkirchen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1945, a combined residential and commercial building was built on the former synagogue site (present-day address: Oberer Markt/Irrgartenstrasse); in 1978, a commemorative plaque was erected there. A memorial has also been unveiled at the cemetery, which, since its reopening in 1955, has been repeatedly vandalized.

Neustadt,1534,,45,"In 1534, the 25 Jews of Neustadt made up nearly 10% of the town’s total population; these early Neustadt Jews were expelled in 1570, but not before they had managed to consecrate a synagogue (in 1540) and a cemetery (in 1541). It was not until the 19th century that Jews were permitted to return to Neustadt, after which they established a community (in 1854), a new cemetery (in 1861) and a synagogue (in 1877). This prosperous Jewish community also maintained an elementary school until 1911, but records do not tell us when it was built. Neustadt Jews were involved in many businesses; for example, textile manufacturing, cattle trading, and selling wholesale clothing. Samuel Fraenkel, the owner of a large cotton mill, financed the construction of the synagogue. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 did not affect the Jews in this area, for the region was protected by the League of Nations’ convention on minority rights. In 1937, however, anti-Semitic legislation was implemented in Neustadt, causing many Jews to emigrate or relocate. A Zionist training farm was set up in the area to prepare potential emigrants for life in Palestine. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire and vandalized, as were Jewish-owned homes and businesses; a Torah scroll was paraded through the streets and burned in public. By 1939, only 39 Jews remained in the city, most of whom were deported to the camps in 1942. A memorial plaque was later unveiled at the synagogue site.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=961,961
Neustadt am Ruebenberge,1792 (four families),100 in 1871,42,"In 1824, by which point Neustadt am Ruebenberge was home to a synagogue on Mittelstrasse, the Jewish community appointed Samuel Hirsch as chairman and an unidentified man as teacher, chazzan and shochet. Although the Jewish cemetery had been consecrated in 1804, its earliest extant gravestone is dated March 5, 1844. The Jewish public school closed down on January 4, 1910, and we also know that an itinerant teacher named Weinberg, of Wunstdorf, instructed children in religion during the years 1913 (seven children) to 1924 (eight children). Neustadt am Ruebenberge belonged to the provincial rabbinate of Hannover. From 1933 until Pogrom Night, 25 Jews left Neustadt am Ruebenberge (only one family emigrated). On November 9, 1938, SA men smashed the synagogue’s windows, destroyed its interior and demolished the roof, after which they wrapped the community’s hearse in a Torah scroll and positioned it opposite the residence of the Jewish Meinrath family, where it was set on fire the following day. Jewish-owned homes and businesses were ransacked, and property was confiscated. On December 2, 1938, Meinrath’s bank was expropriated by the Baebenroth bank. Later, on June 25, 1939, by which point the Jewish population had dwindled to four, the synagogue building and site were sold to a locksmith. Of the 42 Jews living in Neustadt am Ruebenberge in 1933, 21 perished in the Shoah. Nine local Jews emigrated, but the fate of 11 is unknown. Else Fritsche was deported to Theresienstadt on February 19, 1945; an ordeal she survived. The synagogue building was torn down in the early 1950s; a memorial plaque was erected on the site in November 1985. At the Jewish cemetery, in which 61 stones are still intact (a burial took place there as late as 1998), a memorial stone was unveiled in 1968; the cemetery was vandalized in 1956, 1967 and again in 1986.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: HH, HU, PK  ak-regionalgeschichte.de  www.myheimat.de/coelbe/profil/10812/beate-shumate/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=962,962
Neustadt an der Aisch,1287,210 in 1900,74,"Although Jews were persecuted in Neustadt in 1803, a Jewish community was founded there in the mid-19th century. The community established a prayer hall in the 1860s and a synagogue (at 6 Gartenstrasse) in 1880. Local Jews maintained a mikveh and employed a teacher who also served the community as chazzan and shochet. We also know that burials were conducted in Diespeck. Neustadt was the scene of anti-Semitic violence well before the Nazi period: the synagogue’s windows were smashed on two occasions in 1929, and the Diespeck cemetery was desecrated in 1930 and 1933. In 1933, 10 schoolchildren studied religion in Neustadt; two welfare associations and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active there that year. From 1934 onwards, Christians were forbidden to sell bread to Jews; meanwhile, Jews were not permitted to sell bread at all. Fifty-three local Jews had fled by November of 1938. On November 8, 1933, the remaining Jews were ordered to leave within eight days. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night; a fouryear- old Jewish child was severely injured. One month later, in December 1938, the sole remaining Jew left town. At least 23 Neustadt Jews perished in the Shoah.

Neustadt an der Hardt,14th century (perhaps earlier),397 in 1900,266,"The 14th-century Jewish community of Neustadt an der Hardt was destroyed twice during the 1340s: after a blood libel allegation (in 1343) and during the Black Death pogroms (of 1348/49). Jews later resettled there, but it was not until the 19th century that the community experienced significant growth. In 1764, Neustadt’s existing synagogue was replaced by a new synagogue on Hintergasse. Later, in 1867, by which point the Hintergasse building was unable to accommodate the growing Jewish congregation, the Jews of Neustadt established another house of worship on Ludwigstrasse, next door to which they would later (in 1908) build a community center. The community also maintained an elementary school—it became a school for religious studies in 1830— whose teacher served as chazzan and shochet; a residential home for the elderly (founded in 1914); a mikveh; and a cemetery (consecrated in 1862). In 1933, 266 Jews lived in Neustadt. Approximately 47 children received religious instruction, and 40 elderly Jews lived in the old-age home. Several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down, as was the old-age home: two residents were killed by the flames, and several Jewish men were sent to Dachau. In March 1939, the municipality seized the destroyed sites, after which the ruins were cleared. Most Neustadt Jews left before the deportations began. On October 22, 1940, the remaining 22 Jews were sent to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least 33 Neustadt Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1950, a new Jewish community of Rheinland Pfalz was founded in Neustadt. The community established an old-age home, a prayer hall (both closed down in 1987) and a synagogue in the city of Kaiserslautern. A memorial stone was unveiled at the synagogue site in 1954. A new memorial stone was unveiled there in 1988 (the older stone was moved to the Jewish cemetery.)","Yehoshua Ahrens  Sources: AJ, EJL, FJW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=963,963
Neustettin,1718,455 in 1880,124,"Three Jewish families settled in Neustettin (present-day Szczecnek, Poland) in 1718. As one of these arrivals was a gravedigger, it is reasonable to assume that a Jewish cemetery existed in the area. We do not know when the community established its synagogue, but records do tell us that after 1828, a synagogue was located in a timber frame building opposite the city school. Concerned about noise, the authorities did not permit the community to move the synagogue to a more central location. In 1863, the synagogue was broken into and two Torah scrolls were desecrated. Egged on by the incendiary speeches of Dr. Ernst Henrici, anti-Semites set the synagogue on fire in 1881. The Neustettin authorities accused the Jews of committing this crime themselves, and several congregants were tried but subsequently absolved of any wrongdoing. The incident, however, triggered the outbreak of anti-Jewish riots throughout Pomerania and West Prussia; in Neustettin, Jewish-owned homes and stores were vandalized, and Jews were expelled from local associations. A new synagogue was consecrated in Neustettin in 1883. The congregation was served by a rabbi, a teacher and a cantor during the years 1885 to 1908, after which a community official assumed these duties. After 1895, at which point Jews made up five percent of the total population, the community began to dwindle, a tendency that accelerated once the Nazis gained power. On Pogrom Night (November 1938) the synagogue was burned down—the surrounding premises were secured—Jewish-owned stores were plundered and Jewish men were detained in the basement of the municipal building before being deported. The remaining Jews were deported in 1940/41, and we also know that more than 100 Neustettin Jews perished in the Shoah. The Jewish cemetery, located near Wasserturm, was destroyed during the Nazi period; the mortuary is now a Protestant church.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, FJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=965,965
Neustrelitz,approx. 1700,600 in 1802,62,"During the 1800s, the city of Alt-Strelitz was the most important Jewish community in Mecklenburg, home to the largest Jewish population, the largest synagogue and the most prestigious and respected rabbi in the region. This was made possible by a local duke who welcomed the Jews and allowed them to establish prayer rooms, a cemetery and an elementary school. When the Jewish community outgrew the prayer rooms, Duke Adolf Friedrich IV not only approved the decision to purchase land for a synagogue, but gave of his own money and helped arrange financing for the endeavor. The synagogue—a massive building—was completed in 1763; the inauguration ceremony was attended by local landowners and politicians. Nearly a century later, in 1847, the synagogue was completely renovated, after which it was inaugurated once again. Rabbi Jacob Hamburger served as rabbi for nearly fifty years until his death in 1911. He apparently kept the community together, for it was after his death that many Jews left Alt-Strelitz. Jews and Gentiles coexisted peacefully in Alt-Strelitz until 1935. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), three young Nazis broke into the synagogue, smashed all the windows and set it on fire. Shortly afterwards, the Jewish community was forced to pay for the building’s demolition. In 1988, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SIA, WDJMV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=966,966
Niedenstein,1664,147 in 1861,63,"In 1807, the Jewish community of Niedenstein built a small, unimposing synagogue, on one side of which were a school and a mikveh, and on the other a cemetery. The school was in operation until 1928. A wealthy community member, Calmann Michaels, donated a new building in 1816—at the urging of the Baalshem (a renowned rabbi) of Michelstadt—to show his thanks and appreciation to G-d for his miraculous recovery from a serious illness. Although Michaels’ donation covered the raw building costs, the community had to come up with the funds to furnish the synagogue’s interior, a challenge it met by pre-selling seats. In 1828, the large, one-story synagogue was enlarged to include a women’s gallery. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was vandalized and destroyed. Converted into an apartment building in 1945, the building has, since 1988, displayed a memorial plaque.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: AJ, DJGH, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=968,968
Neuwied,1661,410 in 1910,281,"Although the Jews of Neuwied were able to employ a series of rabbis from the 17th until the mid-19th century, they never established their own cemetery, choosing, instead, to use the regional cemetery (consecrated in the 17th century) in nearby Niederbieber. In 1748, the community replaced its prayer room on Untere Schlossstrasse with a synagogue on Engerser Strasse (later renamed Synagogenstrasse, or “synagogue street”); the new synagogue, which was renovated in 1844 and again in 1883, seated 42 men and 42 women. Neuwied was also home to a mikveh. In 1844, the town’s Jewish elementary school (established in 1818) moved to the renovated synagogue building; the schoolteacher sometimes served as chazzan, and a second chazzan performed the duties of shochet. In 1933, 281 Jews lived in Neuwied; this figure does not include 50 converts to Christianity, who were later classified as Jews under the 1935 Nuremberg Laws. Eighteen pupils attended the Jewish school, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations were active in the community, to which the Jews of Heddesdorf, Irlich, Fahr, Rodenbach, Rockenfeld and Wollendorf were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s ritual objects were taken outside and burned. The building itself was blown up, the burial hall was damaged and Jewish- owned homes and stores were destroyed. In early 1939, 111 Jews remained in Neuwied, most of whom were eventually deported to the East. At least 101 Jews originally from Neuwied and 20 from its affiliated Jewish communities perished in the Shoah. The post-war Jewish community established a prayer hall in 1947.

Most Jews left Nieder-Florstadt, so that by 1939 only 10 still lived there. In September 1942, the last five Jews were deported to Izbica (Poland). At least 28 former Jewish residents of Nieder-Florstadt perished in the Shoah. The synagogue ruins were cleared in 1942; sold on an unspecified date, the site later accommodated a cabinetmaker’s shop.

Nieder-Mockstadt,18th century,89 in 1861,35,"The Jewish community of Nieder-Mockstadt, founded in 1806, apparently conducted services in a prayer room until 1836, when a synagogue was built at 1, Orlesstrasse. The Jews of Staden and Nieder-Mockstadt maintained a Jewish school in the early 19th century; beginning in 1912, the communities of Nieder-Mockstadt, Nidda and Geiss- Nidda ran a teacher’s association together. A new cemetery was consecrated in Nieder-Mockstadt in 1880, a new mikveh in 1906. In 1933, a chevra kadisha was active in the community.

Records indicate that the community established a prayer room in, at the latest, the 18th century. We know for certain that the prayer room burned down in 1827, after which local Jews consecrated a new prayer room in a private residence (at 34-35 Elpenroeterstrasse), with 85 seats and a women’s gallery.

On New Year’s Eve, 1918, the synagogue’s windows were smashed. Although services were not conducted in the synagogue during the years 1924 to 1936—probably for lack of a minyan and a chazzan—the community still managed to consecrate a Jewish cemetery, located inside the municipal burial grounds, in 1936, prior to which burials had been conducted in Jugenheim. In 1933, Nieder-Saulheim’s Jewish population was 29; the three Jews of Ober-Saulheim (Upper Saulheim) were affiliated with the community. Later, in 1936, the Jewish community of Mainz sent a chazzan and some congregants to Nieder-Saulheim, enabling the resumption of synagogue services there. The political situation, however, deteriorated to such an extent that, in August 1938, the Union of Jewish Communities of Hesse asked the Jewish authorities to send food to the beleaguered Nieder-Saulheim community, as German shop owners and traders were refusing to sell to Jews. On Pogrom Night, at which point 10 Jews lived in Nieder- Saulheim and one in Ober-Saulheim, the synagogue was destroyed. The community was disbanded shortly afterwards.

On November 11-12, 1836, the community inaugurated a synagogue at 13 Bahnhofstrasse; the building accommodated 60 worshipers, a schoolroom and an apartment for a teacher. Niederaula was home to a school for religious studies and, from 1868 to 1933, an elementary school; Jakob Gans of Rotenburg taught there during the years 1886 to 1931. Local Jews also maintained a mikveh and a cemetery, the latter of which was established in the 19th century and now contains 60 gravestones. By June 1933, only 76 Jews lived in Niederaula. A welfare society, a sisterhood, an Agudah youth group and a society “for the beautification of the synagogue” were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, rioters ravaged the synagogue and Jewish properties. At the synagogue, Nazis threw out the Torah scroll, shattered the chandeliers and broke windows. One eyewitness reported that Nazi thugs hit his 86-year-old grandfather and raped his sister. A seven-year-old child, who in fright jumped from a window, was severely injured. Three Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald; they returned, pale and sick, several weeks later. Thirty-four local Jews had emigrated by 1941. Deportations from Niederaula began on February 5, 1941, when at least 15 Jews were sent to Frankfurt; on April 1, 1942, seven Jews were deported to the East; and in June 1942, the last transport left with Niederaula’s last two Jews, Karoline and Salomon Levi. At least 76 Niederaula Jews and seven from Hattenbach (an affiliated community) perished in the Shoah.

The modern Jewish community consecrated a new cemetery on Auf dem Hahnenhuegel/Im Kennelgraben in 1860. Earlier, in 1842/43, the Jews of Niederkirchen purchased a barn (15 Talstrasse) and renovated it as a Moorish-style synagogue; the synagogue, which opened in 1850, seated 90 men and, in the gallery, 50 women; it also housed a school and an apartment for a rabbi—employed until 1918—or a teacher. The synagogue annex burned down in 1931, and the community, which by then had dwindled considerably, was unable to rebuild it. In 1933, 19 Jews resided in Niederkirchen. A Jewish women’s group provided the remaining Jews with welfare services. Although only 13 Jews lived in Niederkirchen in 1938, the synagogue was nevertheless burned to the ground on Pogrom Night.

Niedermarsberg,17th century,162 in 1865,93,"Records from 1672 indicate that five Jewish families lived in Niedermarsberg that year. The modern Jewish community inaugurated a synagogue in, at the latest, 1844. That house of worship burned down in 1849, and a new synagogue building was inaugurated at 18 Im Weist in October 1856. Other communal institutions included a Jewish school, founded before 1820, that became an elementary school in 1863; the school was moved to Paulinenstrasse in 1904 and closed in 1934. In Niedermarsberg, a cemetery was consecrated on In der Hamecke in 1875 or 1885 (sources of information differ); both sources agree that the burial grounds were closed in 1948. In 1933, Niedermarsberg was home to 93 Jews. A teacher/chazzan instructed 14 schoolchildren at the Jewish elementary school and 14 at a secondary school. Two welfare organizations—and Israelite men’s association and one for women—saw to the needs of the poor. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), SS troops from Arolsen destroyed the synagogue, throwing furniture and ritual objects into a nearby water source; they did not, however, manage to burn down the building. The synagogue was sold after Pogrom Night and converted into a storeroom. Approximately half of all local Jews emigrated from Germany before the pogrom; the others left in 1939. Twenty-four Jews from Niedermarsberg and the neighboring communities were deported in 1942/43. At least 36 local Jews perished in the Shoah. Today, the former synagogue houses a discotheque, opposite which a memorial plaque was unveiled in 2003. In 2009, memorial stumbling stones were unveiled in Niedermarsberg.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, HU, LJG, SIA, W-G, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=978,978
Niedermendig,17th century,unknown,38,"In 1858, the Jewish population figures for Niedermendig (Lower Mendig) and nearby Obermendig (Upper Mendig) were 42 and 34, respectively. The Jewish cemetery, which had been consecrated south of Niedermendig in 1889, also served the Jews of Obermendig. Earlier, in 1864, the Jewish communities of Niedermendig, Obermendig, Thuer and Kottenheim decided to build a synagogue. Unable to agree on a location, they instead built two synagogues (in 1886): one for Thuer and Kottenheim, the other for Niedermendig and Obermendig, the latter of which was built on Wollstrasse and inaugurated in 1886. Soon afterwards, the Jewish population of Obermendig declined as more Jews moved to Niedermendig, so that, in 1895, 54 Jews lived in Niedermendig and five in Obermendig; in 1925, no Jews lived in Obermendig. In 1933, Niedermendig’s Jewish population was 38. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was destroyed. Nineteen Niedermendig Jews emigrated from the country, three relocated within Germany and seven were eventually deported to the East. At least 23 Jews originally from Niedermendig perished in the Shoah. A memorial sculpture was later unveiled in Niedermendig (now part of the town of Mendig).","Heidemarie Wawrzyn Sources: AJ, EJL, BJGGRP, LZR, SG-RPS, SIA, YV  www.cardamina.de/rev_csb00001.html",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=979,979
Niederweidbach,18th century,43 in 1885 (10% of the total population),26,"The Jewish community of Niederweidbach, many members of which were cattle traders, presumably developed in the 18th century. By 1842, local Jews had inaugurated a synagogue at 23 Hauptstrasse, providing 29 seats for men and 14 for women; Jews from Mudersbach and Altenkirchen attended services at the Niederweidbach synagogue. Other communal institutions included a school for religious studies, a mikveh and a cemetery, the last of which was consecrated near Rossbacher Strasse in the mid-19th century. In 1850, prior to which they had been affiliated with the Jewish community of Gladbach, the Niederweidbach Jews formed an independent community. In 1933, 26 Jews resided in Niederweidbach, with an unspecified number of children receiving religious instruction. Four Jews from Mudersbach and eight from Hohensolms were affiliated with the community. As a result of increasing anti-Semitism, many local Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the interior of the synagogue, throwing furnishings onto the street. Later, in 1940, the windows and a door in a Jewish home were shattered on several occasions. In 1942, between 14 and 16 local Jews were deported. At least 25 Niederweidbach Jews and five from Mudersbach perished in the Shoah. The Jewish cemetery, restored after the war, is now a protected historical site.

Established in 1829 and rebuilt in 1878, the Jewish community center housed a school, a mikveh and an apartment for a teacher who served as chazzan and shochet. Niederwerrn was also home to a district rabbinate (after 1839) and two welfare societies, one of which was a Jewish women’s association. Burials were conducted in Euerbach. Forty-five Jews lived in Niederwerrn in 1933; two children received religious instruction. Windows in Jewish homes were smashed in 1934 and again in 1938; a local Jewish woman was attacked and injured in 1935. On Pogrom Night, a group of 50 SA men and local residents looted Jewish homes; one Jewish woman was raped, and another—a 70-year-old—was thrown into a river. The rioters also destroyed the synagogue’s interior, setting the ritual objects on fire. Four local Jews were sent to Dachau on Pogrom Night, soon after which the remaining Jews were forced to sell their homes and move into one building. Both the synagogue and community center were sold to the municipality for far less than their actual value. Between 1934 and 1940, 21 local Jews emigrated and 18 moved to other cities in Germany. Nine were deported to Izbica and Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 40 Jews originally from Niederwerrn perished in the Shoah.

Later, however, the Niederwiesen community consecrated its own cemetery on Morscheimer Weg. Other communal institutions included a synagogue (1745), a new synagogue (1770), a mikveh (1840) and yet another synagogue (1864). The Jewish school, which operated in a small building located near the second synagogue, was opened in 1845; in 1852, 19 boys and 11 girls were enrolled there. In 1933, after decades during which community membership had steadily dwindled, only 20 Jews lived in Niederwiesen. The rabbinical authorities denied the community’s request to disband, and, in 1934/35, elections were held for a community leader. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was destroyed. The building’s ruins were later cleared. Seven Jews immigrated to the United States, 11 relocated within Germany and two died in Niederwiesen. The village’s last Jews had left by the end of 1939.

Other communal institutions included the following: a new synagogue—it housed a schoolroom and an apartment for the teacher—at 29, Marienstrasse (1799); a cemetery on Richterstrasse (1840); and a Jewish elementary school (1890). Burials were conducted at the cemetery until 1942. Five children received religious instruction in 1933, and records also tell us that the community was able to hire a shochet that year. Although SA men destroyed the interior of the synagogue on Pogrom Night (November 1938), local residents prevented them from setting fire to the building; a Jewish home and store were damaged during the violence. Eleven local Jews emigrated from Germany in the years 1933 to 1939. Twenty-six were deported in late 1941/42. At least 72 Nieheim Jews perished in the Shoah.

Niederzissen,17th century,89 in 1854,approximately 45,"By 1763, the Jewish community of Niederzissen had established a prayer hall, a school (both were located in private residences) and a cemetery. Later, in 1841, a synagogue was inaugurated on Schmidsberg (later renamed Mittelstrasse). Niederzissen’s Jewish elementary school, which also housed a mikveh, opened in 1857, but was closed just one year later. We also know that, in 1904, the community hired a teacher of religious studies. Six schoolchildren received religious instruction in 1933, and a Jewish youth association was active in the community, with which the Jews of Oberzissen and Burgbrohl were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the Niederzissen synagogue wasdestroyed;Torahscrollsandprayerbookswererippedinto shreds and thrown onto the street. That night, the remaining Jews collected the ruined books and buried them in the cemetery. In October and November of 1939, Jewish-owned houses were damaged. A local blacksmith bought the synagogue that year, after which he converted the building into a workshop. In July 1942, 26 Jews from Bad Neuenahr were brought to Niederzissen and used as forced laborers. Later that month, all Jews living in the area were deported to the East. At least 74 Niederzissen Jews perished in the Shoah. The Jewish cemetery was desecrated during the Nazi period and in 1952.

Nienburg on the Weser,1681,143 in 1895,77,"Nienburg Jews prayed in rented facilities until 1817, when the community finally inaugurated a synagogue on Lange Strasse, in a building donated by the widow of Marcus Abraham. Children studied religion in the teacher’s home until the establishment, in 1868, of a Jewish school (closed in 1924). The provincial rabbinate was located in Hanover, but the Nienburg community maintained its own cemetery. In 1933, a chevra kadisha, a sisterhood, a society for Jewish history and literature and a Zionist youth group were active in the community; no Jews, however, still lived in the previously affiliated withwns of Drakenburg, Lohe and Siedenburg by 1933. Records suggest that the aforementioned literature group ceased its activities after the death of the teacher, Mr. Solly Katz. On Pogrom Night, SA troops and several local people destroyed the interior of the synagogue, its ritual objects, and Jewish-owned homes and businesses, including the Marcus Abraham family’s furniture store. After the destruction of the synagogue, L. Weinberg and six others established another synagogue association. After January 1939, when the smaller Jewish cemeteries in the surrounding towns were closed, all burials were conducted in Nienburg; by then, the Jewish population had dwindled to 19. On March 28, 1942, the remaining 18 Jews were sent to ghettos, concentration camps or death camps.

The town of Frucht was then the region’s Jewish religious center, and the community there maintained a synagogue; in 1852, however, following the enactment of a new system of worship in Nassau, Nievern became the region’s religious center. Services were conducted in a prayer room, located in the house of a local butcher, where the paint, Torah Ark and worshipers’ skullcaps were in the color lilac.

Nuremberg [Nürenberg / Nuerenberg],1112,"9,280 in 1922","approximately 9,000","The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Nuremberg is dated 1112. Jewish communities were destroyed in Nuremberg in 1298 and again in 1349. All Jews were expelled from the city in 1499, and it was not until the 19th century that Jews re-established a presence there. Nuremberg Jews established a Jewish religious association in 1859, and, in 1862, an official community, which became Franconia’s major Jewish community and the second-largest in Bavaria. The city’s first synagogue was inaugurated in 1296. In the 13th century, Nuremberg was home to a Jewish cemetery and a famous yeshiva. (Several leading scholars, including Mahari Weil and Yaakov Polak, would later head the yeshiva.) The synagogue was destroyed during the Black Death pogroms of 1349 and replaced by a church. A new synagogue was built a few years later, and we also know that the city authorities closed the yeshiva in 1406. Nuremberg’s modern Jewish community initially conducted services in rented prayer halls. A regional rabbinate was established in the city in 1872, and in 1874 the community inaugurated a grand synagogue with a seating capacity of 935. Orthodox Jews founded their own religious association, the Adat Israel, in 1875. Adat Israel inaugurated a synagogue—the building also housed a mikveh—in 1902; in 1908, after reaching an agreement with the mainstream community, Adat Israel employed an Orthodox rabbi. Yet another synagogue was inaugurated in 1917 by the Achiezer association of Eastern European Jews. Nuremberg was home to a Talmud Torah, its first, from 1859 until 1869. Adat Israel founded anotherTalmudTorahin1908andanelementary school in 1921. In 1926, after the elementary school became the community’s general school, thebuildingwasenlarged.TwoJewishcemeteries were consecrated in Nuremberg: one in 1864, the other in 1910. In 1933, approximately 9,000 Jews lived in the city. The regional rabbi was Max Freudenthal (who was replaced in 1934 by Hans Andorn), and the Orthodox rabbi was Abraham Yitzhak Klein. Many Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community that year. Nuremberg, a Nazi hub, not only hosted the movement’s annual conferences, but was also home to the publishing offices of Der Stuermer, the notorious Nazi tabloid. The infamous Nuremberg Laws were declared in the city during the Nazi party congress of 1935. Nazis in Nuremberg were particularly zealous in their abuse of the city’s Jews, and many Jewish residents were randomly arrested. When Jewish pupils were expelled from German schools, the community responded by enlarging the Jewish elementary school; for this purpose, local Jews rented and renovated a large building at 25 Obere Kanalstrasse. (The school also offered professional training.) City authorities destroyed the main synagogue in August 1938, after which services were conducted in the school’s sports area. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the Orthodox synagogue was burned down together with its contents. The Achiezer synagogue and its contents were also destroyed, as was the mikveh. Jewish businesses and homes were vandalized; merchandise and personal belongings were either looted or destroyed. So many Jews were assaulted by club-wielding rioters that the medical staff at the Jewish hospital in Fuerth, unable to provide beds for the wounded, treated patients on the floors and in the corridors of the hospital. Sixteen local Jews were murdered during Pogrom Night, and most of the 160 arrested Jews were sent to Dachau, where one died. Ten Nuremberg Jews committed suicide. After the pogrom, Orthodox services were conducted in one of the school’s classrooms. Later, at some point after 1941, the Gestapo ordered the Orthodox Jews to move their services to the school’s sports area, where the mainstream community prayed. The deportations of Nuremberg’s Jews began in November 1941, and continued until June 1943, when the community was dissolved. Sixty Jews, all of whom were married to Christians, remained in the city after the deportations, but 10 were deported to Theresienstadt in January 1945. At least 1,800 Nuremberg Jews perished in the Shoah. The new Jewish community of Nuremberg was founded in December 1945.

Jews were detained at the mayor’s offices, where they were abused (some were sent to the prison in Schweinfurt), and Jewish homes and businesses were ransacked. Thirty-nine Obbach Jews emigrated (30 of them went to the United States) and two relocated within Germany. In June 1939, a Jewish woman with Polish citizenship was expelled to Poland. In April 1942, 30 Jews were deported, via Wuerzburg, to Izbica. Obbach’s last six Jews were sent to Schweinfurt in June 1942, and were deported from there to Theresienstadt (also via Wuerzburg) in September. At least 86 Obbach Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial was later affixed to the remains of one of the former synagogue’s walls.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=994,994
Obbornhofen,in or around the year 1820,26 in 1830,6,"This community, made up of Jews from Obbornhofen, Bellersheim and Wohnbach, maintained administrative offices in Bellersheim and a synagogue in Obbornhofen, which was located at 9 Kommenturgasse. Other communal institutions included a Jewish school and a mikveh. Records indicate that Jews from Obbornhofen and Bellersheim sought to hire teachers separately during the 1860s, which may mean that the two groups then functioned as separate communities. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, only six Jews lived in Obbornhofen. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the Obbornhofen synagogue was set on fire, but not before its interior had been plundered. According to Yad Vashem, the aforementioned six Jews were killed in the Shoah. Obbornhofen is no longer home to a Jewish community.

Ober-Gleen,1700s,58 in 1880,25,"Although the Jewish community of Ober-Gleen was comparatively small, it had all that a community needed: a synagogue, a school, a mikveh and a cemetery. On one of his visits to Ober-Gleen in 1846, State Rabbi Levy implored the congregation to renovate and enlarge its small synagogue, to which the community responded by establishing a fund for the construction of a new house of worship. Finally, in 1871, the community had enough money to inaugurate the new synagogue. From 1933 onwards, many local Jews immigrated to the United States and to Palestine; by 1939, no Jews lived in Ober-Gleen. Earlier, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), Nazi rioters ravaged and demolished the interior of the synagogue. The destroyed building was appropriated by a metalwork factory and converted into a shop. In 2008, plans were drawn up to redesign the former synagogue building as a cultural center.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: AJ, DJGH",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=996,996
Ober-Seemen,17th century,151 in 1861 (17.1% of the total population),76,"The Jewish community of Ober-Seemen, founded in the 18th century, established a new synagogue—one had apparently existed there in the 18th century—at 4-6 Mittelseemer Strasse in 1901. Ober-Seemen’s Jewish elementary school, established in 1875, was presided over by a teacher who served as chazzan and shochet; the school closed down in 1923, but Jewish schoolchildren continued to study religion with a teacher from Gedern. The Jews of Ober-Seemen also maintained a mikveh and a cemetery. In March 1936, windows and doors in Jewish homes were broken; two weeks later, six Jews were assaulted. The last synagogue service took place in 1937, after which the building was sold to the municipality for one-fifth of its actual value. The community was dissolved in early 1938, but that did not protect the Jews of Ober-Seemen on Pogrom Night: homes were searched, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed and two Jewish men, the last, were sent to Ortenberg, where they were brutally beaten before being deported to Buchenwald. Most of the younger Jews emigrated; the older ones, however, relocated within Germany. At least 43 Ober- Seemen Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue housed POWs during the war. The building, which fell into private ownership in 1978, was converted into an institute of psychotherapy and a conference center.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AH, AJ, DJGH, EJL, PK-HNF   www.pfo-online.de  www.gierhardt.de",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=998,998

The community maintained a mikveh and employed a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Local Jews buried their dead in Wenkheim. In 1933, two chevra kadisha organizations (one for men, the other for women) were active in Oberaltertheim. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and Torah scrolls were destroyed. Windows in Jewish houses were smashed, property was wrecked and two Jews were deported to Buchenwald. The synagogue was later sold to the municipality for just over two-thirds of its actual value. Sixteen Oberaltertheim Jews emigrated and two relocated within Germany. In March 1939, Jews were forced to sell their agricultural lands at a greatly reduced price; and in September 1939, the remaining Jews were moved into one building (referred to as the “Jews’ house”). Oberaltertheim’s last four Jews were deported, via Wuerzburg, to Izbica in April 1942. At least 21 local Jews died in the Shoah.

The community used the cemetery in Dieburg, but was able to maintain its own mikveh and a school for religious studies, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Eight schoolchildren received religious instruction in 1931/32. A women’s association and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active in the community. The synagogue’s interior and ritual objects were destroyed on Pogrom Night, after which the building was set on fire (as were several Jewish homes). Jewish families were attacked, their homes and businesses damaged, their property was destroyed. More than 200 locals participated in the riots. The synagogue’s ruins were demolished in 1939.

It is not known until what date services were held in the Oberasphe synagogue, but it is clear that, even in the best of times, the congregation relied on neighboring villagers to complete the necessary minyan. In Oberasphe, the Jewish population began to dwindle in 1933. Later, on Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was ransacked and destroyed.

Other communal institutions included an elementary school—it closed in 1932, when only 10 children were enrolled there—and a Jewish cemetery, the latter of which was located in the vicinity of the synagogue. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was plundered and devastated, shortly after which the building was converted into an apartment building. The building was demolished in 1969 due to unsafe structural conditions. A memorial plaque was unveiled at the old cemetery’s site in 1984.

The exact location of that synagogue was unknown until pages of Hebrew text were found during renovations of the area; it is likely that the texts belonged to Erich Meyer, a printer. Oberbieber Jews were able to maintain their own Jewish school (unknown location), but records do not mention a mikveh. Burials were conducted in Niederbieber. In 1925, only 25 Jews lived in Oberbieber. Most of the remaining Jews left the town after the implementation of the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933. Later on Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA men burned down the synagogue, but not before shattering its windows and vandalizing the building; members of the fire brigade were ordered to protect neighboring structures from the blaze. The site was sold on August 20, 1940. According to Yad Vashem, 31 Oberbieber Jews were killed in the Shoah. Oberbieber is no longer home to a Jewish community.

Oberdorf-Bopfingen,,,,"Bopfingen’s 13th-century Jewish community disappeared after the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. Although Jews were expelled from Bopfingen and from Oberdorf (a village belonging to Bopfingen) in the 16th century and again in 1659, a Jewish presence was re-established there shortly afterwards. Rabbis served Oberdorf’s 19th-century community, and the village was also home to a regional rabbinate from 1832 until 1931. The community established synagogues in 1704 and in 1744/45, respectively; the latter of which was located at 15 Lange Strasse; in 1812, when the Lange Strasse synagogue was deemed unsafe, a new synagogue was inaugurated (renovated in 1858). Other communal institutions included a cemetery (consecrated in 1825) and a school (1820s). Recognized as a public institution in 1840, the school was renowned for the quality of the education provided there, attracting Christian pupils; in 1924, as a result of low enrollment, it was closed down. In 1933, a teacher/chazzan instructed 13 children in religion. Several Jewish associations and branches of nation- wide Jewish organizations were active in the community. The Jewish school reopened in 1936. On Pogrom Night, non-local SA men set the synagogue on fire. Local residents, both Jews and Christians, managed to extinguish the blaze, but not before a section of the interior had been destroyed. Ten Jewish men from Oberdorf and one from Bopfingen were sent to Dachau on Pogrom Night; two were separated from the group and shot, one of them fatally. In 1939, the building was sold to the municipality for much less than its actual value, as were other Jewish-owned buildings and the cemetery. During the war, 200 Jews from Stuttgart and from other places in Wuerttemberg were brought to Oberdorf, where, together with the Jews of Bopfingen, they were forced to live in crowded conditions. Of these Jews, 230 emigrated, 21 died in Oberdorf and 86 were deported to the East; all but two of the deported Jews died, as did 36 Oberdorf Jews. A memorial was unveiled at the cemetery in 1985. The synagogue building was used by a Catholic congregation from 1950 until 1968, after which it was used as a storage site. A local society bought the site in 1989, and the renovated building was opened as a memorial center in 1993. In 1997, a museum on the history of the Jews in the region was established there.","Rachel Borut  Sources: AJ, PK-BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1003,1003
Oberelsbach,mid-18th century,70 in 1837,28,"In 1899, four years after the Oberelsbach Jewish community’s older synagogue had burned down (along with most of the village), a new synagogue and mikveh were established on Elsweg. Burials were conducted in nearby Neustaedtles, and the Jewish communities of Oberelsbach and nearby Nordheim jointly employed a teacher of religion. In 1933, only four Oberelsbach children studied religion, with a teacher from Unsleben. The synagogue was broken into on Pogrom Night. The next afternoon, SA men from outside Oberelsbach, aided by many local residents, wrecked the homes and businesses of Oberelsbach’s last seven Jews, and destroyed the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects. Eight Jews were arrested and imprisoned in Neustadt an der Saale. Between the years 1933 and 1941, 13 Oberelsbach Jews emigrated and six relocated within Germany; three others left for unknown destinations. In February 1942, nine Jews lived in Oberelsbach. Of these, seven were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in April 1942; in June of that year, two were sent to Wuerzburg, after which, in September, they were deported to Theresienstadt.

Oberglogau,13th century,174 in 1861,60,"The medieval Jewish community of Oberglogau (present-day Poland) was destroyed during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. Although records do not tell us when Jews returned to Oberglogau, we do know that, in 1560, the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand I, expelled a Jewish settlement from the town. It was not until the 19th century that a new Jewish community was established there. That community built a wooden house of worship in 1812. In 1864, the prospering congregation built a synagogue in grand style, with a tower at each of its four corners and a dome. Thirty years later, the community—Oberglogau Jews were inclined towards Reform Judaism—built a community center adjacent to the synagogue. Owing to a clause in the League of Nations agreement on minority rights, which prevailed in Silesia, Oberglogau Jews were spared the Nazis’ excesses until 1937. On Pogrom Night, however, the synagogue was set on fire, Jewish-owned homes and businesses were vandalized and many Jews were arrested. In November 1942, the six remaining Jews were deported. Although the synagogue building was set on fire in Pogrom Night, the walls survived the blaze.

There are differing opinions as to whether or not a synagogue existed in Oberhausen an der Appel. According to an academic from the University of Mannheim, a synagogue was destroyed in Oberhausen on Pogrom Night, an assertion for which no evidence is supplied.

Records from 1859 indicate that a synagogue, which served both communities, had been inaugurated on Am Felseneck (in Oberhausen) a few years previously; the building housed a mikveh and, on the lower floor, an apartment for a teacher—he also served as chazzan and shochet—and a school. The Jews of these two villages retained their cemeteries, each of which was consecrated in the late 19th century (in 1895 in the case of Oberhausen), even after the founding of the joint community. Before then, both communities had buried their dead in Herschberg. In 1933, three Jewish schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from Zweibruecken. On Pogrom Night, SA men destroyed the interior of the Oberhausen synagogue. Later, in 1941, the synagogue was demolished to make way for a wider road. Sixteen Jews from the Oberhausen-Wallhalben community emigrated from Germany. In 1940, the remaining 12 were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France. At least eight Jews from Wallhalben perished in the Shoah; no definite numbers are available for Oberhausen due to the multiplicity of communities with that name.

Oberwesel,1241,53 in 1890,44,"Jews were massacred in Oberwesel during the Black Death pogroms of 1349. Although individual Jews settled in Oberwesel during the ensuing centuries (records from 1452 mention a synagogue), it was only in the 18th century that an actual community began to emerge there. Oberwesel’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in the early 19th century, if not before. By 1836, the community had inaugurated a synagogue. Records from 1853 refer to a new synagogue, and we also know that in 1886, one year after the second synagogue burned down, the community built a new house of worship on Schaarplatz; the building housed a mikveh and a school for religious studies, the latter of which was presided over by a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan. In 1933, 44 Jews lived in Oberwesel; five children received religious instruction. A women’s association and a chevra kadisha were active in the community that year. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, prayerbooksandTorahscrollswerethrownintoastreamand windows in Jewish-owned homes were smashed. Later, in 1940, the municipality appropriated the synagogue building. Oberwesel’s last Jews were deported to the East in 1942. At least 18 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue, renovated in 1957, accommodated a police headquarters and, later, a residence. Since 2007, the building has served as the headquarters of the Rabbi Hillel organization, which promotes Jewish-Christian dialogue; in honor of Oberwesel’s destroyed Jewish community, that organization has unveiled a memorial.","Yehoshua Ahrens  Sources: AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1014,1014
Ochtrup,1720,43 in 1848,unknown (44 in 1931),"Owing to local administrative resistance, the growth of this Jewish community, made up largely of cattle and meat dealers, was very slow. Prayer services were conducted in private residences until the 1860s, when the community acquired a plot of land on which it inaugurated a synagogue in 1868. In order to provide religious instruction for children, the community hired a teacher from nearby Bergstein. In the early 1900s, local Jews, hoping to attract new congregants, made plans for the construction of a new synagogue, but these plans fell through due to a lack of funds. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was vandalized by local Nazis who hurled the ritual objects, including the Torah scrolls, onto the street. The fire brigade extinguished the ensuing fire, but the building was demolished in 1959 and rebuilt for residential purposes. A memorial plaque was unveiled at the site in the mid-1980s. Fourteen local Jews were deported to Eastern Europe in 1941/42; it is not known if any survived.

Ockenheim,1661,,29,"The Jewish community of Ockenheim, founded in or around the year 1750, may have established a prayer hall at some point during the 18th century. We know for certain, however, that the community inaugurated a synagogue at 27 Bahnhofstrasse in 1835; thoroughly renovated in 1883, the synagogue was enlarged to accommodate a women’s gallery. Although the Jews of Ockenheim were able to maintain a mikveh, funerals were conducted in Gau-Algesheim. Records suggest that the village was home to a Jewish elementary school in 1870. Later, the community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, 29 Jews lived in Ockenheim; two Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction. All Jews managed to leave the village before Pogrom Night, the last departing in September 1938; two immigrated to the United States while the others relocated within Germany. Although the synagogue had been sold to a Christian in 1935, its windows were smashed on Pogrom Night. At least 38 Ockenheim Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue’s new owner—the building was later used as a storage site—rejected several appeals to renovate the building, wanting, instead, to tear it down. In 1991, however, the building was declared a protected historical landmark.

Odenbach am Glan,1627,139 in 1854 (10 % of the total population),27,"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Odenbach am Glan refers to a Jewish family living there in 1627. Local Jews probably congregated in a prayer room during the 17th century, and we know for certain that a synagogue was built between Kuemmelstrasse and Kirchhofstrasse in 1752. Renovations were carried out there in 1835, during which a women’s balcony with 30 seats was added (the main sanctuary seated 50 men); the synagogue was renovated again in the early 20th century, this time to include elaborate wall paintings, for which the house of worship would later become famous. At the cemetery (consecrated in 1845), the last burial took place in 1938. In 1932/33, 27 Jews lived in Odenbach. The Jews of Lauterecken were affiliated with the community. Later, on Pogrom Night, SA men wrecked the synagogue’s interior, allowing local children to steal and burn five Torah scrolls; they did not, however, burn down the synagogue, as the building was located next to several other structures. The Jewish community was forced to sell the synagogue in October 1939. Odenbach’s last two Jews were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. Two Jewish men, both of whom were married to Christians, survived the war in Odenbach. Yad Vashem has the names of at least seven Odenbach Jews who perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue was awarded protected monument status in the 1980s. In 1985, wall paintings and a geniza (a storeroom for holy books) containing a Torah curtain and other ritual objects were discovered there. Purchased in 1989 by the Society for the Preservation of the Odenbach synagogue, which renovated the building thoroughly, the former synagogue was opened as a memorial in 1996.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: AJ, EJL, FGW, SIA, SG-RHN, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1018,1018

The modern community was founded in 1889. Prior to 1889, when the synagogue on Untere Torstrasse was inaugurated, the community conducted services in a prayer room. The synagogue accommodated 60 men, 52 women, a mikveh and a schoolroom, the last of which was presided over by a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan. In 1933, 30 children studied religion in Oehringen. Several Jewish associations were active in the town. The synagogue’s interior was demolished on Pogrom Night; Jewish men were sent to Dachau, where one died. In 1939, the once-thriving community was disbanded. Later, in 1940, the cemetery—it had been consecrated in 1911—was cleared. Approximately 120 Jews emigrated, five died in Oehringen and 36 were deported to Eastern Europe. At least 46 Oehringen Jews died in the Shoah. In 1939, the synagogue was sold to the municipality.

We also know that the community maintained, albeit intermittently, a private Jewish school until 1922, by which point the student body had diminished to such an extent that it was no longer viable to keep the school open. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was vandalized and its ritual objects strewn on the street. The building itself was not destroyed, as it had already been appropriated by the local authorities and “aryanized.” Rebuilt in 1940 as a business complex, the building is used in that capacity to this day.

A Jewish community was established in Oels in the mid- 1700s. Local Jews conducted services in a rented prayer room until 1839, when a synagogue, equipped with a mikveh, was built. The community consecrated a cemetery in or around the year 1839. Oels was not only an important center for Jewish life, with many Jewish organizations headquartered there, but also the seat of the regional rabbinate. Nevertheless, the Jewish population diminished to such an extent that by 1937 only 17 Jews still lived in the town. On Pogrom Night, the Nazis burned down the synagogue and several Jewish-owned businesses and homes. The cemetery survived the war undamaged, but fell into disrepair after 1945.

Oerlinghausen,17th century,74 in 1872,19,"By 1766, the Jews of Oerlinghausen had established a community and hired a teacher of religion. Oerlinghausen’s Jewish cemetery (located in Barkhauser Berg) had been consecrated in the 17th century. The community’s prayer hall, which was located in a private residence, was established in, at the latest, 1769. Local Jews received permission to build a synagogue in 1800, the construction of which was completed in 1803 (renovated in 1832). In 1893, the community inaugurated a new synagogue on Toensbergerstrasse. Oerlinghausen’s Jewish school—it was located in a private residence—became an elementary school in the early 19th century and, in 1892, a school for religious studies. During the early decades of the 20th century, children studied religion with teachers from neighboring communities, as the Jews of Oerlinghausen were no longer able to employ their own teacher. By the late 1920s, the community could no longer gather enough men for a minyan. The remaining Jews traveled to Bielefeld for synagogue services, using their own synagogue for funerals. A local Jew was severely beaten in public in 1935. In July 1938, the synagogue was sold to a local resident. The former house of worship was attacked on Pogrom Night, but a local Nazi leader prevented its destruction, citing the fact that the building was no longer owned by Jews. A Jewish-owned business was destroyed on Pogrom Night, and two local Jewish men were arrested. A Jewish child was born in Oerlinghausen in 1940. Ten local Jews emigrated (six of them went to South America), six relocated within Germany and two passed away in Oerlinghausen. In December 1941, a Jewish couple (the town’s only remaining Jews) was deported, via Bielefeld, to Riga. At least eight Oerlinghausen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Oettingen,13th century,440 in 1837 (13.4% of the total population),66,"The earliest record of Oettingen’s Jewish community refers to the pogroms of 1298 and 1348/49. A Jewish presence was once again established in the town in the mid-16th century. Several leading rabbis lived in Oettingen, which was divided between Lutheran and Catholic rulers. Accordingly, there were two Jewish communities, two synagogues and two regional rabbinates until 1731, when the communities were united. Local Jews established a cemetery in 1850 and a new synagogue, on Schaefflergasse, in 1853. Oettingen’s Jewish elementary school closed down in 1928. The arrival of a Jewish family from Moenchsroth (with official permission) sparked a large demonstration in November 1937. The father of the family was assaulted, after which he was hospitalized and, later, placed in “protective” custody. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, as were its ritual objects and 13 Torah scrolls. The community’s archive and library were destroyed, Jewish homes and stores were wrecked and Jewish men were deported to Dachau. Ten Oettingen Jews emigrated, 45 relocated within Germany and six died in Oettingen. In 1942, six were deported to Piaski (via Munich). The town’s last two Jews were moved to Hainsfarth in April 1942; their fate remains unknown. At least 31 Oettingen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Offenbach am Main,14th century (possibly earlier),"2,360 in 1910","1,435","Offenbach’s Jewish community was annihilated during the Black Death pogroms of 1348. When the Jews of Frankfurt were expelled from the city in 1614, they settled in Offenbach and founded a new Jewish community there. A Judenstrasse (“Jews’ street”) was established in 1702, another in 1708. Offenbach developed into an important center for Hebrew printing during the 18th century. Jacob Frank, the Shabbatean pseudo-messiah who lived in Offenbach during the years 1788 to 1791, attracted thousands of devoted visitors to the city; his daughter, Eva, maintained his court until 1817. The Jewish population remained at approximately 1,000 during the 19th century. Between 1913 and 1916, the community built a beautiful, domed synagogue with a seating capacity of 800. Jews were successful in local industries, especially in leather and textiles, and they owned the larger department stores. Prominent Jews included the Offenbach family, made famous by the Romantic composer and cellist Jacques Offenbach. At some point during the second half of the 19th century, as Liberal Judaism became predominant in Germany, 25 local families established an Orthodox congregation without seceding from the mainstream community. Eastern European Jews, the so-called Ostjuden, made up a large chunk of the city’s Jewish population. Many Polish Jews were expelled in 1936. From 1933 onwards, as was the case all over Germany, Jews in Offenbach faced severe social and economic measures; many Jewish-owned businesses were “aryanized” during the 1930s. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was burned to the ground; Offenbach’s rabbi, Max Dienemann, a leading figure in progressive Judaism, was imprisoned.  Five hundred and fifty-four Jews still lived in Offenbach on May 17, 1939. Of these, 205 were deported in October 1942; the rest were deported soon afterwards, mostly to Theresienstadt and to Auschwitz. Approximately 400 Offenbach Jews are known to have perished in the Shoah. Jews returned to Offenbach in 1956 and consecrated a new synagogue there. By 1970, the Jewish population numbered 662; and by 2005, 960 Jews—half of whom were from the former Soviet Union—lived in Offenbach.

Inaugurated in 1831, the community’s prayer room was located on Piastowski Square, adjacent to a castle.

Jews were permitted to return to Offenburg in 1862, after which they established an official community (in 1865), a prayer room (in 1868) and a cemetery (in 1870). The Offenburg synagogue, dedicated at Langestrasse in 1875, was renovated in 1922 and again in 1934. The school was located there, as was an apartment for a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet.

Local Jews were served by two community leaders and a teacher/shochet. On June 6, 1829, the community inaugurated its first synagogue in a rented house at 5 Muehlenstrasse; the ceremony was presided over by Dr. Marcus Adler, Oldenburg’s first provincial rabbi. The community bought the house—it also housed a schoolroom and an apartment for the provincial rabbi—in 1832. On August 24, 1855, a new synagogue was inaugurated on Peterstrasse. Children studied religion at the community center, located next to the synagogue. The building was remodeled in 1904/05 (the architectural style incorporated Oriental features), when a mikveh was added. By 1933, the community was running a chevra kadisha, a sisterhood, a society for unmarried women, a synagogue choir, an orphans’ association, a Henry-Jones lodge and an association for the study of history and literature. In response to anti-Semitic propaganda, the Jews of Oldenburg established the Schild (Shield) athletic group in 1927.

In 1470, a local duke allowed a group of Jews to establish their own street and synagogue, after which the new Jewish community grew at a modest pace (70 members in 1532). Jews were once again expelled from Oppeln in 1563, and it was not until 1746 that a Jewish presence was again recorded in the town. The modern community conducted services in private homes until 1842, when Rabbi Abraham Geiger, a prominent leader in the emerging Reform movement, inaugurated a newly-built synagogue. Local Jews also maintained a cemetery (opened in 1822), a library, a ladies’ aid society, a sick fund and a chevra kadisha. In 1853, Adolf Wiener, a Reform rabbi, was appointed rabbi of the community. The economic situation of the Jews in Oppeln improved during this period, as did their social and professional standing in the town. In order to accommodate the growing Jewish population, the community built, in the years 1893 to 1897, an impressive, domed synagogue with a seating capacity of 600; located on the fashionable Haffenstrasse, the synagogue was regarded as one of the outstanding features of the city. Leo Baeck served as rabbi of Oppeln from 1897 until 1907; his wife was a native of the town, and he was instrumental in building a second synagogue there. Zionist organizations and the B’nai B’rith were active in the community, as were the Kameraden youth group (a Jewish hiking club) and several other organizations. Although until 1937 Oppeln Jews were officially protected from the Nazis’ anti-Jewish legislation by the League of Nations’ convention on minority rights, they were subjected to persecution and boycott during the 1930s. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire, after which the building burned down as policemen and firefighters stood idly by; Rabbi Hans Kirchberg was forced to apply the torch himself. Jewish-owned stores were destroyed that night, as was the community center. Two hundred and eighty Jews remained in Oppeln in 1939.

The Jewish cemetery, originally owned by one family, became public property in 1850. The community built a small synagogue on the corner of Altstadtstrasse and Lessingstrasse in 1879, and we also know that the synagogue district of Opladen and the Jewish surrounding communities was formed in the mid-19th century. In 1933, the Nazi Party called for the boycott of Jewish-owned stores and businesses. Party members prevented customers in Opladen from entering these stores and publicly ridiculed those who continued to do so. On Pogrom Night, “unknown persons” broke the synagogue’s windows and destroyed its interior. The building was burned down the following day. Twenty-nine Opladen Jews died in concentration camps; five committed suicide. One Jewish woman was hidden by a neighbor and survived. The synagogue arsonists were tried after the war.

Ortelsburg,1768,199 in 1871,approximately 120,"The history of Jewish Ortelsburg (Polish: Szczytno) began in 1768, when Berek Samulowitz and Isaak Lewin received permission to settle there. The community consecrated a cemetery in 1815; a synagogue in 1835; and a new synagogue and mikveh, on Polnische Strasse, in 1886. Russian troops destroyed the synagogue during the first weeks of World War I, and it was not until 1923 that a new house of worship, designed by August Wiegand, was inaugurated in Ortelsburg. Beginning in 1835, the Jews of Ortelsburg employed a chazzan and a Jewish teacher. In 1847, Ortelsburg founded a synagogue community with the Jews of Friedrichsdorf, Passenheim, Schwentainen and Willenberg; it was not, however, until years later that the government officially approved the “statutes for the synagogue community of Ortelsburg.” The Deutsche Freiheitsbewegung (German Freedom Movement) triggered an increase in anti-Jewish violence. In the early 1930s, stones and fire bombs were thrown at and into Jewish homes; Nazis attacked Jews on the street. In March 1933, the Nazi Party won more than 87% of the local vote. On Pogrom Night (November 9-10, 1938), the synagogue was burned down. Seventy-five local Jews perished in the camps.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: EJL, LJG  www.sztetl.org",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1033,1033
Oranienburg,1680,131 in 1925,105,"The Jewish community of Oranienburg established several institutions during the 19th century: a modest synagogue on Havelstrasse (either at no. 6 or 58) was in use by 1838, and a cemetery was consecrated on Kremmenerstrasse in 1815. The congregation chose to retain its own synagogue after the community was incorporated, in 1920, into Berlin’s official Jewish community. Although the Oranienburg Jews were mostly merchants, others gained recognition in other professions. Louis Blumenthal was the town’s first banker, and Nachum Oppenhaimer founded a prominent charity. All Jewish properties were attacked on Pogrom Night, but the main targets were the synagogue and Jewish-owned businesses. The ruins of the synagogue and community center were destroyed by bombs during the war, and we also know that government buildings were later built on the site. Sachsenhausen, the second largest concentration camp in Germany, was located in the Oranienburg district. Werner Michael Blumenthal, a Jewish Oranienburg native, served as Jimmy Carter’s treasury secretary in the late 1970s, after which he was appointed director of the Jewish museum in Berlin. Oranienburg’s new Jewish congregation was founded in 2000. A memorial plaque has been unveiled at the former synagogue site.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1032,1032
Osann,mid-16th century,143 in 1843,17,"In 1899, when the community’s synagogue—it had been inaugurated at some point during the first half of the 19th century—was deemed unsafe, the Jews of Osann built a new house of worship on Hauptstrasse (later called Bernkasteler Strasse). The community, with which the Jews of Monzel were affiliated, also maintained a mikveh, a cemetery and a school for religious studies whose teacher served as shochet and chazzan. In 1933, 17 Jews lived in Osann and seven in Monzel. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters damaged the synagogue and vandalized Jewish homes. Nine local Jews emigrated; the others relocated in Germany. By May 1939, all Jews had left Osann. At least 16 Osann Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue, which had been sold to a private buyer after the pogrom, has since been used as a storage site.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AJ, EJL, FGW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1034,1034
Osnabrueck,1260,480 in 1905,403,"Osnabrueck’s 14th-century Jewish community lived on Schweinestrasse (present-day Marienstrasse), where they maintained a prayer room in the Judenschule (“Jews’ school”). The early community maintained two cemeteries: one near Natruper Gate, the other near Heger Tor (consecrated in 1386). Local Jews established prayer rooms in rented homes in Tuchfelds (at 16 Hakenstrasse) and at 18 Bierstrasse in the early 1820s and the 1850s, respectively. In 1872, the community purchased a house on Barfusskloster and established a synagogue (60 seats) and a Jewish school there, the latter of which was opened in 1886. Finally, on September 13, 1906, a synagogue with seats for 500 worshipers was inaugurated at 3-5 Rolandstrasse (presentday Alte Synagogenstrasse, or “old synagogue street”). Against the community’s will, the 14th-century Jewish cemetery was eventually closed, after which land for a new cemetery was acquired on Magdalenenstrasse. The municipality finally agreed to finance the disinterment and relocation of graves from the old cemetery, a process that was completed in 1894. In 1933, the community maintained a chevra kadisha, a sisterhood, a Bikur Cholim society for visiting the sick and an Ezra aid society, the last of which originated in Osnabrueck and helped survivors of the Russian pogroms immigrate to Palestine. Founded in 1924, a welfare organization aided itinerant Jews from Eastern Europe; in 1926, 5,428 needy Jews benefited from this group’s services. B’nai B’rith was active in Osnabrueck, as were Jewish pioneer groups and sports clubs. On Pogrom Night, SA men ransacked and set fire to the synagogue; Osnabrueck’s mayor ordered that the ruins be demolished the next day, for the municipality planned to use the site for its own purposes. Another group of SA men arrested and abused local Jews: between 20 and 30 of them were eventually sent to Buchenwald; those who were married to Christians were sent to Sachsenhausen. After their release, both groups were encouraged to leave the country immediately. Some of those who had been in Buchenwald were later sent to the death camps in Poland. In March 1939, the community was forced to sell the synagogue. Later, in 1941, 69 Jews lived in Osnabrueck, of whom 25 were moved into a “Jews’ house” (with just four rooms) at some point after August 1941. Nine patients from a local health institute were sent to Wunstorf in 1940, after which, on September 27, 1940, they were sent to Brandenburg and murdered by means of poison gas. On December 13, 1941, 35 local Jews were deported to Riga. We also know that in late July 1942, 27 elderly Jews—including a female convert to Christianity—were sent to Theresienstadt, from where several were later deported to either Minsk or to Auschwitz. And on March 1, 1943, the last seven residents of the “Jews’ house” on Kommenderiestrasse were deported to Auschwitz. Forty local Jews who had escaped to the Netherlands were brought back and deported, as were a married couple who had fled to Brussels; according to records, this couple died in Auschwitz. In all, 142 Osnabrueck Jews perished in the Shoah. Five Jews survived the war in Osnabrueck. On June 1, 1969, Osnabrueck’s new Jewish community received a synagogue and community center from the municipality. In 1970, paintings by Felix Nussbaum, the renowned Jewish artist, were discovered in Belgium and returned to Osnabrueck, where, in 1998, the Felix Nussbaum Museum was opened. In 1978, a memorial stone was unveiled at the former synagogue site. The Magdalenenstrasse cemetery was repaired in 1997 and again in 1999. Due to the arrival in Osnabrueck of many Russian Jews, the Jewish community grew from 61 in 1991 to 400 in 1996.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: HH, PK",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1035,1035

In 1830, the community opened a new synagogue at Teichstrasse; it burned down in 1863/64, after which, in 1865/66, another synagogue was built on Bahnhofstrasse. The Bahnhofstrasse synagogue, renovated in 1897, housed a school and an apartment for a teacher. The Jewish communities of Osterholz nearby Scharmbeck were united in 1927. In 1932/33, a teacher/chazzan instructed three pupils in religion. On Pogrom Night, SA troops destroyed the synagogue— it had been rented out earlier that month—and vandalized homes, shops and the cemetery. Jews were assaulted, and several Jews, including three women, were imprisoned in Lesum, after which the men were deported to concentration camps and the women released. In 1939, the remaining Jews were moved into “Jews’ houses”. The synagogue was sold and converted into a school for the study of aerial defense. Thirteen local Jews emigrated from Germany. Several committed suicide, and others were deported, via Bremen, to Minsk, Theresienstadt and to other camps in 1941, 1942 and 1944. At least 21 Osterholz-Scharmbeck Jews and six from nearby Ritterhude perished in the Shoah.

Osterode,1707 (possibly earlier),unclear,123,"The Jewish community of Osterode (present-day Ostroda, Poland) was established in 1707. Available Jewish population figures for Osterode are as follows: 214 in 1895, 200 in 1913 and 240-250 at some point in the early 20th century. Several Osterode Jews were involved in municipal politics, even as magistrates. In 1735, the community consecrated a cemetery at Armii Ludowej, surrounded by what is now a broken masonry wall and gate. Osterode’s synagogue—it replaced a prayer room first mentioned in records from 1735—was inaugurated in 1893. By 1937, the Jewish population had dropped to 75. Those who decided to leave were forced to sell their businesses and property at great financial loss: Dr. Julius Samulon, for example, received 5,000 Reichsmarks for a house worth 132,000. The synagogue and cemetery were destroyed on Pogrom Night. By May 1939, all but one Jew had left Osterode. A monument, commemorating the 25 Soviet citizens who were buried there, was later unveiled at the ravaged cemetery, where, according to a recent source, one can find several intact gravestones. On Langer Krummer Bach, a memorial plaque in German and Hebrew commemorates the destroyed synagogue.

Osterode am Harz,15th century (possibly 14th century),123 in 1830 (2.8 % of the total population),,"The Jewish community of Osterode was founded in 1697. A rabbinate was based in Osterode from 1698 until 1709 and again from 1809 until 1813. The 17th-century Jewish community established a synagogue in a private residence—a rear building on Langer Krummer Bruch. The Jews of Osterode purchased the synagogue site in the 1780s; in 1893/94, the front building was converted into a school and an apartment for the teacher. The synagogue was replaced by a larger house of worship in 1788, and we also know that the community maintained two cemeteries: the first, established in or around the year 1670 and enlarged in 1844, was closed in 1863; the second, established on Schwimmbadstrasse, opened in 1869. In 1934, Jewish-owned stores were damaged. A shochet and a teacher/ chazzan served the community that year, and three schoolchildren received religious instruction. A local branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith (established in 1924) and a Zionist group (founded in 1935) were active in the community of the 1930s. The community was dissolved in June 1938. On Pogrom Night, SS men destroyed the synagogue’s interior and the teacher’s apartment. Jewish homes and a Jewish-owned store were vandalized, and four or five men were imprisoned. The synagogue and school were sold in 1938. At least 29 Jews emigrated from Germany; 15 moved to other German cities or to the Netherlands. Two Jews were deported to Theresienstadt in 1942 and 1945. Between three and ten Osterode/Harz Jews perished in the Shoah.

Osthofen,mid-16th century,126 in 1885,62,"Jews were expelled from Osthofen in 1693, but another Jewish presence was established there in, at the latest, 1722. By the mid-18th century, the community, which had been founded in cooperation with the Jews of Westhofen, had consecrated a prayer hall and a cemetery. In 1875, the community replaced its first synagogue (built in 1917) with a new synagogue at 53 Hauptstrasse (present-day 74 Friedrich-Ebert-Strasse); the synagogue was renovated in 1929. Local Jews also maintained a mikveh and a regional cemetery, the latter of which was consecrated in 1840 and desecrated in 1932. Three children studied religion with a teacher/chazzan in 1933, by which point the Jews of Rheinduerkheim, Abenheim, Pfeddersheim and Westhofen had been affiliated with the Osthofen community. In March of that year, community chairman Ludwig Ebert’s paper factory was turned into a concentration camp; it was closed in December 1934, but not before Ebert and other local Jews had been held there under “protective custody.” Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was destroyed, after which the building was set on fire. Eleven local Jews emigrated from and 48 relocated within Germany. In January 1939, the remaining Jews left Osthofen. At least 17 Osthofen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Paderborn,mid-14th century,421 in 1901,273,"The medieval Jewish community of Paderborn was destroyed during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, and it was not until the 16th century that another Jewish presence was established in the town. From 1704 onwards, under the protection of the bishopric, the Jewish population began to grow, if only moderately. Services were conducted in a prayer hall with adjacent classrooms until 1882, when the community inaugurated a synagogue; the octagonal building seated 200 men and, in the gallery, 120 women. Later, in 1893, the community consecrated a new cemetery, as the older cemetery—it had been established in 1703—was no longer able to accommodate the growing Jewish population. We also know that the Jews of Paderborn maintained an orphanage whose building housed a synagogue and classrooms. By the early 1930s, Paderborn was home to many Jewish merchants, doctors, lawyers and other professionals. Accordingly, the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 financially  crippled the community. An anti-Jewish demonstration in 1935 strengthened the determination of many to leave Paderborn. On Pogrom Night, rioters vandalized the synagogue’s interior and set the building on fire. The synagogue property was forcibly sold later that year, as was the cemetery site. The remaining Jews continued to conduct services in the orphanage’s synagogue, where David Koeln instructed approximately 50 children in, among other subjects, Hebrew and English, with the aim of preparing them for immigration to Palestine. In 1940, the orphanage building and several nearby houses served as a Jewish quarter; the remaining Jews (most of whom were elderly) of Paderborn and from the neighboring communities were moved there before the final deportation of 1942. Between September 1939 and February 1943, 100 Jewish men and women were interned in a forced labor camp in Paderborn’s industrial quarter; all were deported in February 1943. After the war, a few survivors reestablished the Jewish community, and in 1959 a new house of worship was inaugurated near the old synagogue site, where a memorial plaque has been unveiled.

In 1933, a Jewish women’s association was active in the community; a teacher from Illingen instructed schoolchildren in religion. After the Saar region was returned to Germany (March 1935), most Jews left Ottweiler: 25 emigrated and 35 relocated within Germany. The synagogue’s interior, furniture and ritual objects were destroyed on Pogrom Night; Ottweiler’s Jewish cemetery was desecrated, Jewish-owned homes and businesses were vandalized and Jewish men were assaulted and sent to the Saarbruecken prison, from where the younger men were transferred to Dachau.

In 1840, the community built a small synagogue behind a large apartment building; Pasewalk’s Jewish population had doubled by 1850, which necessitated an immediate expansion of the synagogue. In 1930, as a direct result of the swiftly deteriorating political situation, Jews began to leave Pasewalk in large numbers. Nevertheless, the community celebrated its centennial anniversary in 1932.

Schoolrooms were added to it in 1929; however, Jews were already leaving the town by then, a trend that accelerated after the anti-Jewish boycotts of 1933 and the resulting discontinuation of synagogue services. On Pogrom Night, rioters desecrated the cemetery and pushed over the tombstones. The interior of the defunct synagogue (which had been preserved) was destroyed, but the structure was left intact and later used for secular purposes: as a school, a warehouse, and, finally, as an apartment block to which a memorial plaque was affixed in 1950. The few Jews who still lived in the town after Pogrom Night were presumably deported, but we do not have information about their fate.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1048,1048
Petershagen,1600,208 in 1875,43,"Town records indicate that a prayer hall existed in Petershagen in 1652, as did a cemetery—its oldest extant tombstone is dated 1692—known locally as Judenberg (“Jews’ hill”). From 1800 onwards, the growing Jewish community participated increasingly in the town’s commercial and municipal affairs. We also know that in 1846, local Jews inaugurated a synagogue whose schoolrooms were used until the late 1930s.  The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 triggered the emigration of the bulk of the Jewish community. Although the municipality had appropriated the synagogue building before Pogrom Night, rioters nevertheless vandalized its interior that night, destroying the women’s gallery and throwing out the ritual objects and Torah scrolls. The local fire brigade extinguished the ensuing fire, as the property had been “aryanized.” Later restored, the building now houses a museum, an archive and a memorial plaque. In 1941, seven Petershagen Jews were deported to Riga; the remaining few were deported to the death camps in 1943.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1050,1050
Peine,1603 (see below),300 in 1762,103,"Jews settled on the outskirts of Peine in 1603, but it was only in 1807/13 that a Jewish presence was established inside the town. The community maintained a synagogue, an elementary school (1838-1873) and a cemetery, the last of which was located in Telgte and enlarged in 1803. In 1907, a new synagogue—it also housed a schoolroom and a teacher’s apartment—was inaugurated on Bodenstedtstrasse/ Goethestrasse (present-day Hans-Marburger Strasse). The old synagogue was demolished. In 1932/33, 16 Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction. A teacher and chazzan were employed, and the community maintained a women’s welfare organization (established in 1919) and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith; records from 1899 and 1924 mention a chevra kadisha, but we cannot say for certain that it still functioned in 1933. On Pogrom Night, rioters damaged the synagogue, the cemetery and Jewish-owned stores. Sixteen men were arrested the next morning, and SS troops vandalized Jewish homes; Hans Marburger, a sixteen-year-old teenager, was murdered. The synagogue was set on fire, after which, in 1939, its ruins were pulled down. Peine’s Jewish cemetery was destroyed at some point after 1942, the same year during which a housing company bought the synagogue site. By August 1939, two-thirds of the Jewish population of 1933 had left Peine. The remaining Jews were forcibly moved into a barracks on Woltorfer Strasse in 1941/42. In 1942, 1944, and 1945 Jews from Peine and Haemelerwald were deported to Warsaw and to Theresienstadt. At least 60 Jews originally from Peine and nearby Hohenhameln perished in the Shoah. (Haemelerwald and Hohenhameln were affiliated with the Jewish community of Peine.) Today, the synagogue site serves as a park. Memorial stones and slabs were erected at the synagogue site (in 1948 and 1979, respectively), at the cemetery (before 1947) and at the Marburger and Perel family homes (in 1999 and 2000, respectively). Several memorials were desecrated in 1950, 1971 and again in 1990.

Pforzheim,13th century,"1,000 in 1927",770,"The history of Jewish Pforzheim commenced in the 13th century. Jews were persecuted there in 1260 and again in 1348/49, and were expelled in 1614. The modern community was born in the late 1600s, and eventually established the following institutions: a synagogue in 1812/1813; a new house of worship, at Zerrennerstrasse, in 1892 (renovated in 1930); a Jewish elementary school in 1832; and two cemeteries (one in 1846, the other in 1877). The school was closed in the early 1870s, after which the community employed a teacher of religion who also served as a shochet and chazzan. Although anti-Jewish incidents proliferated in the 1920s—anti-Semites broke the synagogue’s windows in 1922, for example, and the cemetery was desecrated four years later—Pforzheim’s Orthodox Jewish community (founded in 1905) inaugurated a prayer room at Rennfeldstrasse in 1926. In 1933, 770 Jews lived in Pforzheim. One hundred and sixty schoolchildren studied religion, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community. Well into the Nazi period, in 1936, the community opened a Jewish elementary school. As was the case all over Germany, Pforzheim’s Polish families were expelled to Poland in October 1938. On Pogrom Night, SA men disguised as postmen entered Jewish homes, beat the inhabitants and destroyed property. Jewish businesses were plundered, their windows broken. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed the following morning: prayer books, Torah scrolls and ritual objects were ripped to shreds and thrown into a water channel, after which the building was incinerated. The Orthodox prayer hall was also vandalized, its Torah scrolls thrown into a garbage pile. The cemetery was desecrated (it would be leveled in 1940), and 23 Jews were sent to Dachau. In 1939, the synagogue’s ruins were cleared at the Jewish community’s expense. The copper roof was confiscated and the plot sold to a factory owner. Five hundred and fourteen Jews emigrated; 183 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. The remaining 51 Jews were eventually deported to Izbica and to Theresienstadt. At least 190 Pforzheim Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1967, a memorial stone was erected at the former synagogue’s site; and in the 1980s the former cemetery was converted into a memorial.

Pfungstadt,1571,260 or 236 in 1871 (sources of information differ),73,"Jews lived in Pfungstadt as early as 1571, but the origins of a functioning Jewish community can be traced back only to the 18th century. In 1819/20, the community, which belonged to the Orthodox rabbinate of Darmstadt II, built a synagogue, a Jewish school (the renowned Israelitisches Lehr- und Erziehungsinstitut) and a mikveh at 8 Hillgasse. Later, in 1922, the renovated synagogue building was re-inaugurated in the presence of Rabbi Dr. Max of Darmstadt. We also know that a memorial plaque honoring local Jews who had fallen in World War I was unveiled at the synagogue. Other communal institutions included a cemetery on Alsbacher Bergstrasse and, from 1857 to 1907, the renowned Joel’sche Institut, a Jewish school whose most famous teacher was Chaim Weizmann, later to become the first president of the State of Israel. Many Jews left Pfungstadt for larger cities from the early 20th century onwards, so that the town’s Jewish population dropped from 174 in 1900 to 77 in 1925. In 1933, 73 Jews lived in Pfungstadt, 20 of whom left that year as a result of the anti-Jewish boycott. Between 1933 and 1939, 49 Jews left Pfungstadt. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night, and Jewish-owned property was vandalized. In 1942, the town’s remaining 18 Jews were deported. According to Yad Vashem, 59 local Jews were murdered in the Shoah. Pfungstadt is no longer home to a Jewish community. The remnants of the mikveh were rediscovered in 1993. In 1970, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site and, in 2001, the building was converted into an educational and memorial center.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, SG-H, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1052,1052
Philippsburg,1337,94 in 1843,50,"The medieval Jewish community of Philippsburg was massacred in the Black Death pogroms of 1348/1349. By 1615, Jews had once again established a presence there. In 1850, the community replaced its prayer room with a synagogue at 17 Alte Kirchenstrasse. Adjacent to the synagogue were a mikveh and a school, the latter of which housed an apartment for a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan—Moritz Neuburger held this post from 1889 until 1929. We also know that, in 1889, a cemetery was consecrated at Im Sand auf dem Wall. Three of Philippsburg’s Jewish children studied religion in 1933, and a chevra kadisha was active in the town. Later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down; Jewish men were deported to Dachau that night. Seventeen local Jews emigrated, three relocated within Germany, five died in Philippsburg and 21 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 29 Philippsburg Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1968, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the synagogue site, then an armaments factory. The factory was converted into a residential building in the 1980s, and the same plaque was affixed to that building. Moritz Neuburger survived the war and returned to Philippsburg. He died there in 1954 and was buried at the Jewish cemetery.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, HU, EJL  www.philippsburg.de",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1053,1053
Pirmasens,1767,approximately 800 in 1924,574,"Pirmasens was home to a district rabbinate from 1827 until 1879, and again between the years 1911 and 1939. Services were conducted in private residences until 1781, when the Jewish community established its first synagogue. In 1844, a larger synagogue was inaugurated in Pirmasens; we do not know much about the synagogue’s architectural style, but records do tell us that it was enlarged and/or renovated on several occasions. The community also maintained a Jewish school (opened in 1828) and three cemeteries (established in 1813, 1867 and 1927). In 1933, 574 Jews lived in Pirmasens; 34 children attended the Jewish school. Dr. Dagobert Nellhaus was rabbi, and the community also employed a teacher and a chazzan. Several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide organizations were active in the community, with which the Jews of Herschberg were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, Christian schoolchildren were assembled and brought to the synagogue site, where they watched the building burn to the ground. Jewish-owned property was vandalized, and 82 Jews were sent to concentration camps. Although a Methodist congregation, located across the former synagogue site, offered its prayer facility to the Jewish community, the police forbade the Jews from congregating there. Accordingly, services were conducted in a private residence. The municipality appropriated the synagogue site—cleared in early 1939 at the Jewish community’s expense—in February 1939, and sold it in 1941. On October 22, 1940, Pirmasens’ remaining Jews were deported to Gurs, France. At least 115 local Jews perished in the Shoah. After the war, houses were built on the former synagogue site. In 1979, a commemorative plaque was affixed to the Methodist church.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, FGW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1054,1054
Plauen,14th century,836 in 1929,652,"Records indicate that Plauen was home to a Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley,” (present-day Nobelstrasse) and a Jewish cemetery after 1943—evidence of the existence of a functioning Jewish community. The cemetery, which was located outside the city walls and near the Stossberger Tor, was probably destroyed when Jews were expelled from Plauen in 1553. It was only 300 years later, when the town was suffering from insufficient industrial development, that Jews returned to Plauen. The modern Jewish community, which was founded in 1884 and included members from nearby Hof, Greiz, Zwickau and Werdau, conducted services in a prayer room in the Zur Pyramide public house. Prayer rooms were subsequently established on Blumenstrasse and in a former factory building on Schillerstrasse. Orthodox Jews used a prayer room on Wettinestrasse and, later, on Alaunstrasse. Finally, in 1930, a modern community center and synagogue were built on the corner of Senefelderstrasse and Engelstrasse. The Jewish cemetery was opened in 1898/9; located near the northern end of Plauen, it was used by Jews from all over the Vogtland area. Anti-Semitic incidents became more frequent in Plauen in the 1920s, as the town had become a Nazi stronghold. Boycotts of Jewish-owned businesses were zealously enforced there, and the community center and cemetery were attacked and desecrated. In March 1933, the community president, Dr. Isidor Goldberg, was taken into “protective custody,” after which, one month later, a Jewish salesman was murdered. In October of 1938, approximately 60 Polish Jews were deported from Plauen to Poland, via Chemnitz and Beuthen. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the community center and synagogue building on fire, and destroyed Jewish homes and shops. All men over the age of 14 were arrested for several days, after which some were sent to Buchenwald. At some point after 1939, the remaining 90 Jews were forced into several so-called “Jews’ houses”; for example, those located at 10 Karlstrasse, 14 Karolastrasse and 80 Karolastrasse, from which those Jews were eventually deported to Theresienstadt. The last transport left Plauen in February 1945. Several hundred Plauen Jews perished in the Shoah; only nine survived. In 1988, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site. The cemetery’s purification hall is now an archive, and a monument honoring the “Jews’ houses” has been unveiled at the Erloeserkirche Protestant church. The Jewish cemetery houses a memorial stele, placed there in 2000, and several Plauen streets have been named after former Jewish citizens of the town, such as Dr. Ewald Simon, Isidor Goldberg and Emanuel Heimann.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG W-G",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1055,1055
Poembsen,late 17th century,46 in 1843,unknown (4 in 1931),"A small Jewish community was founded in Poembsen, now part of Bad Driburg, after the Thirty Years’ War. In or around the year 1800, the community built a prayer hall near the home of one of its members. A purpose-built synagogue, capable of accommodating approximately 70 worshippers, was built in 1886; funding for the construction of the brick synagogue was raised with considerable difficulty by a few dedicated congregants. We also know that local Jews consecrated a cemetery in nearby Nieheim. Very few Jews lived in Poembsen in 1933, when the Nazis implemented the anti-Jewish boycott. On Pogrom Night, the SA broke into the synagogue and vandalized its interior; fortunately, the forewarned synagogue wardens had removed the Torah scrolls prior to the assault. After Poembsen’s remaining Jewish properties had been vandalized and the synagogue incinerated (this happened the following day), the authorities forced the remaining Jews to sell the synagogue property for a paltry 500 Reichsmarks, deducting 300 Reichsmarks for demolition costs. The town’s remaining Jews were deported during the war years.

Only 42 Jews lived there in 1808, but the community later grew as a result of tolerant French policies and the proximity of Bonn, whose administrative district the Jews of Poppelsdorf joined in 1809. In 1902, the community established a new synagogue. We also know that burials were conducted in Endenich. Beginning in 1932, as a result of Nazi persecution, community membership declined markedly. Although the community was dissolved in 1936, the synagogue remained in use. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the building on fire, destroying all but its outer walls. A memorial tablet was later unveiled at the site, now a vacant plot.

Polch,1790,80 in 1911,44,"Records indicate that the Jews of Polch had established a prayer hall on Kirchstrasse by 1850. In 1867, construction work began on a synagogue, located on a street which would later be renamed Ostergasse; it was not until 1877, however, after a series of financial setbacks had delayed the construction process, that the synagogue was finally inaugurated. The community maintained a mikveh until the 1930s. In 1933, 44 Jews lived in Polch; two children received religious instruction. A welfare society and a charity association were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue on fire, damaging the women’s balcony. After the pogrom the community was forced to sell the synagogue to the municipal authorities. By 1941, 24 Jews had emigrated from Polch and 15 had relocated within Germany. The town’s last five Jews were deported to the East in 1942. At least 22 local Jews perished in the Shoah. Although the municipality transferred the synagogue’s ownership to the local post-war Jewish community in 1950, the latter eventually decided to return the building to the authorities, after which it was used a storage site until 1980. Restored during the years 1981 to 1983, the synagogue was thereafter declared a protected monument. Cultural events have been hosted there since 1984, and the building houses a memorial plaque and a permanent exhibition in honor of the destroyed Jewish community.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: EJL, FJG, SG-RHN, SIA, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1057,1057
Potsdam,1630,600 in 1929,565,"In 1671, the Great Elector of Brandenburg allowed 50 persecuted Jewish families from Vienna to settle in the city, after which Potsdam’s Jewish community developed quickly. In 1731, David Hirsch won a monopoly on the kingdom’s velvet trade, an accomplishment that prompted other Jewish entrepreneurs to enter the silk industry. The Jews of Potsdam acquired a cemetery in 1743 and employed their first rabbi, Jehiel Michel of Poland, in 1760. The construction of Potsdam’s first synagogue, inaugurated in 1767 in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Prussia, was made possible by a loan from Frederick the Great. The ground on which the synagogue was built, however, proved too marshy to support the large structure; accordingly, a new synagogue was built on Wilhelmstrasse in 1802. Until 1776, the Jewish community was forced to pay exorbitant taxes and was required by law to purchase—this applied to each new Jewish household—costly china from royal factories. After these crippling taxes were lifted, the community showed its gratitude by donating the synagogue’s silver ornaments to the Napoleonic war fund and, much later, by sending volunteers to the Franco-Prussian War. In 1903, a new house of worship in the Reform style was built on the site of the original synagogue (by then the marsh had been properly drained). By this time, prominent Potsdam Jews included industrialists, professionals and councilmen. A home for Jewish girls was opened in 1929 and, in 1932, a boarding school for Jewish children from families in distress was established in nearby Caputh. The Nazis’ victory in the 1933 elections and the subsequent economic boycott of Jews triggered a Jewish exodus from the city. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, the interior of the main synagogue was plundered; the building was not set on fire because it was adjacent to the city’s post office. The cemetery and chapel were vandalized, as was the Caputh School. Jewish men were arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen. After the pogrom, the post office appropriated the gutted synagogue building, which was eventually destroyed in a bombing raid during the war. Potsdam’s last 40 Jews were deported in 1942, leaving a few survivors in the community’s Jewish retirement home who were, presumably, deported to Theresienstadt. The cemetery and its adjacent chapel were restored 30 years after Pogrom Night, and memorial plaques have been affixed to former Jewish communal buildings. In the 1990s, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe founded a new congregation in Potsdam; by 2006, the city was home to 1,400 Jews. As of this writing, a new synagogue complex is being built on the grounds of the old house of worship; it will contain a community center, a retirement home and the Abraham Geiger rabbinic seminary, the last of which is associated with Potsdam University.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1060,1060

The community owned a mikveh and an apartment building, but buried its dead in Massbach. In 1933, four children studied religion with a teacher from Massbach. A Jewish women’s association was active in the village that year, but it shut down soon afterwards as a result of the Nazis’ economic policies against the Jews. On the morning following Pogrom Night, 60 SA men from Massbach, accompanied by local SA members and many Poppenlauer residents, broke into and wrecked the houses of the village’s last nine Jewish families, after which the rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects. Twenty-two Poppenlauer Jews fled abroad (many to the United States) and five relocated within Germany. In April 1942, 14 Jews were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg); and in July 1942, seven were sent to the Theresienstadt ghetto (also via Wuerzburg).

Prenzlau,1309,423 in 1890,111,"With the exception of the 16th century, during which Jews were banned from the Brandenburg region, Jews maintained a continuous presence in Prenzlau. A functioning community was established there during the 18th century. In 1716, a cemetery was consecrated near the water tower (today’s city park); enlarged on several occasions, the cemetery was moved to Am Suessen Grund (serving Prenzlau and the Jewish communities of Bruessow und Strasburg) in 1890. In 1752, the Jews of Prenzlau established a synagogue in a timber-frame building at Wasserpforte; accordingly, the street was named Tempelstrasse (“temple street”). Eighty years later, the structure was replaced by a simple but solid building with arched front windows. We also know that, in 1825, the rabbi started giving private lectures in his home on Prinzenstrasse; he later established a gender-separated school with three classes. At its peak, Prenzlau was Germany’s third largest community, after Berlin and Frankfurt. The community ran many cultural and religious organizations; for example, a chevra kadisha, a sisterhood and a literature club. Despite the arrival of many Eastern European Jews during the early 20th century, Prenzlau’s population declined as more Jews chose to move to Berlin. As early as 1935, windows in seven Jewish stores were smashed. On November 10, 1938, the synagogue was burned down; homes and stores were vandalized, as was the cemetery; many men were arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen. The Nazis appropriated Jewish-owned businesses and forced the congregation to sell its property to pay for the removal of the synagogue ruins. Approximately 46 Prenzlau Jews perished in the camps; three survived the war.

In 1931, Nazis beat a local Jew so severely that he later died of his injuries. Leo Aris and Jakob Rosenberg were the community leaders in 1932; Georg Salinger was president of the representation committee. That year, four Jewish children studied religion in Preussisch-Holland. The Jewish community was dissolved in 1938, at which point only 15 Jews lived in Preussisch-Holland. The synagogue, however, was nevertheless set on fire on Pogrom Night. In May 1939, eight Jews lived in the town; one local Jew, most likely married to a Christian, lived there until October 1942.

Puderbach,18th century,71 in 1843,39,"In 1852, the Jews of Niederwarnbach, Rodenbach, Oberdreis and Lautzert were affiliated with the Jewish community of Puderbach. The community and its affiliates, however, belonged to the larger Dierdorf community until 1911, when Puderbach was recognized as an independent Jewish community. Initially, Puderbach Jews attended services in Dierdorf. By 1856, they had established two prayer rooms, one of which was located at 12, Steimeler Strasse and housed a mikveh. Finally, in 1911, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Barentoner Strasse. Puderbach was also home to a Jewish cemetery, consecrated in the latter half of the 19th century. Until the mid-19th century, the community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Later, teachers from other communities instructed Puderbach’s Jewish schoolchildren in religion. In 1933, 39 Jews lived in Puderbach; Jews from Urbach (26) and Steimel (16) were affiliated with the community. Five years later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned to the ground; one Torah scroll was rescued from the blaze. The ruins were cleared one week later, after which the site was sold. Twelve local Jews emigrated, 29 relocated within Germany and eight, Puderbach’s last, were deported to the East in 1942. At least 13 Puderbach Jews and two from nearby Steimel perished in the Shoah. In 1979, two memorial plaques were unveiled in Puderbach: one at the cemetery, the other at a local church.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, JUP",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1065,1065
Pyritz,1481,327 in 1871,100,"In 1705, seven Jewish families lived in Pyritz (present-day Pyrzyce, Poland). Pyritz’s Jewish cemetery, consecrated (at the latest) in 1735, was located near Muehlengraben, bordering the city cemetery. We do not know when the community opened its modest synagogue on Wollenbergstrasse, but records suggest that it was as early as 1794; in 1870, the synagogue was moved to a new building. This flourishing Orthodox congregation employed a rabbi from 1850 to 1893, after which a community official served as spiritual leader of the congregation. Local Jews maintained a sisterhood, a charity group, a chevra kadisha and a library. In 1895, right before the community membership started to dwindle, Jews made up 3 percent of the general population. Nazi boycotts crippled what remained of Pyritz’s Jewish business community. In April 1935, a gang of Hitler Youth members broke the synagogue’s windows. That same year, a branch of the German Zionist organization was founded in Pyritz. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. More than 70 Pyritz Jews were murdered in the camps.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, FJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1066,1066
Quakenbrueck,1842,95 in 1899,74,"The Jewish community of Quakenbrueck started to grow during the mid-19th century. In 1865, the community applied to the district rabbinate of Hanover for help in building a synagogue. The appeal was rejected, and it was not until 1897, by which point the Jews of this small town had prospered, that the community built a synagogue with schoolrooms. Quakenbrueck was also home to a Jewish elementary school. Jews played a prominent role in the economic progress of the town, and Jewish-Christian relations were harmonious. Six local Jewish men were awarded the Iron Cross during World War I; two fell in the line of duty. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 was not zealously enforced in Quakenbrueck, and comparatively few Jews left the town. Nevertheless, Quakenbrueck was not spared the ravages of Pogrom Night, when a group of SA men from nearby Cloppenburg raided the synagogue, set it on fire, burned the ritual objects and Torah scroll, vandalized Jewish homes and arrested Jewish men. When war broke out in 1939, a mere 14 Jews still lived in the town, from which they were later deported. In 1983, a memorial plaque was unveiled in memory of Quakenbrueck’s former Jewish community.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: EJL, JGNB, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1067,1067
Raesfeld,1575,43 in 1849,unknown (22 in 1932),"Two Jewish families were expelled from Raesfeld in 1683. A Jewish community was later established there without the required permission of the authorities, an offense for which the entire community was imprisoned in 1740. In 1750, however, a Jewish man named Israel Jost received a letter of protection from the authorities, which was renewed when he died in 1807; his descendants would form the bulk of Raesfeld’s future Jewish community. The Jewish population (most local Jews were cattle dealers) grew while Raesfeld was under French rule. In 1812, the community converted a barn into a prayer hall and classroom. Later, in 1863, a synagogue—it housed a mikveh and classrooms—was built in Raesfeld. Local Jews operated an elementary school from 1835 until 1880, after which (until 1900) children received religious instruction from teachers who served Raesfeld and its surrounding Jewish communities. Rabbis from Borken or Recklinghausen officiated at weddings and funerals. Few Jews lived in Raesfeld in 1933, and the local authorities, probably out of regard for their amiable relationship with the town’s Jews, did not enforce the boycott. The synagogue was nevertheless vandalized and looted by local SA men on Pogrom Night. The cemetery was desecrated in 1940, and the remaining Jews were deported in 1941/1942. Approximately 36 Raesfeld Jews were murdered in the Shoah.

On Pogrom Night, when only 34 Jews still lived there, the synagogue was burned down. At the site, now a parking lot, a memorial plaque commemorates the destroyed synagogue. Of the 34 Jews who witnessed Pogrom Night in Rahden, most left during the early years of the war, mostly for other towns or cities in Germany. On July 28, 1942, three local Jews were deported.

Randegg,1656,251 in 1849,62,"The Jewish community of Randegg employed rabbis throughout most of its existence. Randegg’s yeshiva, founded in the mid-18th century, earned regional renown. In 1810, the community decided to replace its 17th-century synagogue with a new house of worship near Hauptstrasse; the new synagogue housed a library, a schoolroom and quarters for a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan. Randegg’s cemetery, consecrated in the 17th century, was located at Gewann Floezler. In 1933, three Jewish schoolchildren studied religion in Randegg. A chevra kadisha, a women’s association and a charity association were active in the town. All Jewish-owned businesses had closed by 1938. On Pogrom Night, an SS commando placed the mayor under house arrest before blowing up the synagogue; the explosion destroyed the building, its contents (including approximately ten Torah scrolls) and the adjacent rabbinate building. The mayor resigned in protest. Thirty local Jews emigrated, nine relocated within Germany and five died in Randegg. The remaining 17 Jews, together with 11 from Villingen (an affiliated community), were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 42 Jews originally from Randegg perished in the Shoah.

Rastatt,14th century,230 in 1875,155,"Jews were persecuted in Rastatt in 1337/38, and expelled from the town in 1584 and again in 1615. The new Jewish community, established in or around 1683, had opened a prayer hall (in a private house) by the year 1720. Rastatt Jews dedicated a synagogue on Hildastrasse (present-day Ottersdorferstrasse) in 1829. The synagogue was renovated in 1859 and again in 1882, and in 1906 a new 322-seat house of worship was inaugurated on Leopoldsring. The community not only maintained its own cemetery (consecrated in 1881) and mikveh, but also employed a teacher of religion who served as shochet and chazzan. In October 1931, one day after the community celebrated the synagogue’s twenty-fifth anniversary, Nazis smashed the building’s windows. Twenty-eight Rastatt schoolchildren studied religion in 1933, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the town. Later, on Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue on fire and looted Jewish-owned businesses; Jewish men were sent to Dachau that night. A residential building was later constructed on the synagogue site. Thirty-eight local Jews emigrated, 19 relocated within Germany and 29 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1942. At least 51 Rastatt Jews perished in the Shoah.

Although most Jews were small-time merchants, one prominent businessman, Levin Pintus, was a textile contractor for the army. The community attained official status in the mid-18th century, but it was not until 1926, prior to which services were conducted in a private residence, that the community built a synagogue. The cemetery, whose oldest tombstone is dated 1692, was replaced by a new burial ground in 1905. Rathenow’s rabbi and several local Jews were arrested in 1933. As a result of its proximity to other buildings, the synagogue was not burned down on Pogrom Night; instead, the thugs contented themselves with wrecking its interior and burning the Torah scrolls. Homes were wrecked, and Jewish men were taken to Sachsenhausen. In 1941, 29 Jews, crammed into so-called “Jews’ houses” from which they would later be deported, lived in Rathenow. Plaques were later unveiled at the cemetery and at the former synagogue, the latter of which is now a children’s home.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1073,1073
Rastenburg,in or around the year 1820,141 in 1880,117,"In 1916, the Jewish community of Rastenburg inaugurated a new synagogue on Wilhelmstrasse, replacing its old synagogue on Rollberg (which had been opened 60 years before). The Jews of Barten, Drengfurt, Rhein, Korschen, Langheim and Wilkendorf were affiliated with the community in Rastenburg. In January 1933, a Nazi newspaper accused local Jews of ritual murder. One hundred and seventeen Jews lived in the town in June of that year; 32 schoolchildren received religious instruction from a teacher, who also served as chazzan. Active in the community were a library, a literature club, a chevra kadisha (founded in 1888), a Jewish women’s association and local branches of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith and the Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers. By August 1938, only 62 Jews lived in Rastenburg. Although the Jewish community had sold the synagogue building in September of that year, the synagogue was nonetheless set on fire on Pogrom Night (November 1938). Thereafter, Rastenburg’s Jewish population continued to dwindle, and by May 1939, only 29 Jews still lived there.

Ratibor,1367,"1,500 in 1881",563,"Although a Jewish community of cattle dealers, moneylenders and craftsmen flourished in Ratibor at some point during the Middle Ages, the town later adopted the stance of “non tolerandis judaeis” (not tolerating a Jewish presence in the town). Nevertheless, a new Jewish community developed in Ratibor (present-day Poland) in the late 17th century, and acquired a cemetery before 1813. In order to accommodate the growing Jewish population, the Ratibor community established its first synagogue in 1828/29 and enlarged the building in 1860. Later, in 1890, the increasingly prosperous community inaugurated an impressive synagogue built in Neo-Baroque style. Ratibor was also home to several Jewish societies—cultural, Zionist, charitable, Reform—and a Jewish school. From the 1880s onwards, however, after reaching its peak population, the community started to dwindle as more and more Jews left Ratibor in search of better economic opportunities in the cities. Local Jews were not affected by the Nazis’ anti-Jewish legislation until 1937, as the area was protected by the League of Nations’ convention on minority rights. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire, as were Jewish-owned homes and businesses (including two distilleries). By 1942, there were only 200 or so Jews left to be deported to the camps.

Ratzebuhr,1720,approximately 100 in the 19th century,22,"According to records, a Jew settled in Ratzebuhr (presentday Okonek, Poland) for the first time in 1720. Two more Jewish families settled there shortly afterwards, and in 1752 the Jewish population was 23. Ratzebuhr’s Jewish cemetery (it was concealed by the buildings on Tempelburgstrasse) was probably consecrated in or around the year 1752, as records from that period mention a Jewish gravedigger. The Jewish community, which grew to a respectable size during the early 19th century, eventually established a synagogue at the crossroads—also called Hindenburgplatz— of Tempelburgstrasse, Danziger Strasse and Forststrasse. An official performed the duties of teacher, chazzan and shochet. By 1889, however, the community was no longer hiring the aforementioned official. The cemetery and synagogue were closed in 1890 and 1920, respectively. As was the case all over Germany, the situation deteriorated further following the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933. In 1935, a sign was placed at the entrance to the town warning that Jews entered “at their own risk.” Although the synagogue was sold in September 1938, it was nevertheless burned down on Pogrom Night. The chairman of the congregation was arrested and compelled to pay for the demolition of the synagogue’s ruins.

One source claims that in 1849, through the largesse of one of its members, the community acquired a spacious building and converted it into a synagogue, a school and a mikveh; the same source claims that a few years later the community made plans to erect a second floor, but that those plans were never realized. According to another source, a synagogue was not built in Rauischholzhausen until 1872. With regard to the demise of the synagogue, once again there are two opinions, one of which maintains that in 1935 local hoodlums destroyed the synagogue and broke the windows and doors of the few remaining Jewish homes. Another source, however, argues that only the synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night.

This new house of worship also housed a small synagogue for weekday services, as well as schoolrooms and a mikveh. A cemetery was acquired in 1820, but a new one was consecrated in 1905. Recklinghausen’s active and multilayered Jewish community was home to many immigrants from Eastern Europe whose orthodox ways did not sit well with the more established Jewish families.

Jews were expelled from Regensburg in 1519, and it was only in 1861, after legal restrictions were lifted, that a substantial Jewish presence was established there. Regensburg, a center of Jewish scholarship, was home to Rabbeinu Tam, Rabbi Yehuda He-Hasid, several ba’ale tosafot (Tosafists) and many other prominent personalities. The Jews of Regensburg established a cemetery in 1822, an elementary school in 1832, a synagogue in 1841 and another synagogue, the community’s last, in 1912. (This building, like its predecessor, housed a school, a mikveh and other community institutions.) In 1933, Magnus Weinberg served as district rabbi. Twenty students attended the school, and the community ran numerous Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations. Well into the Nazi period, in 1938, a Jewish retirement home was opened in the city. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, after which the building and the adjacent school were set on fire. Jewish apartments and businesses were vandalized that night, and hundreds of Jews were locked in the local prison, from which 30 men were deported to Dachau. A Jewish man was beaten so severely that he died of his wounds. During the Nazi period, 233 Regensburg Jews emigrated and 111 relocated within Germany. In April 1942, 103 Jews were deported, via Munich, to Piaski; in July and September of 1942, 125 were deported to Theresienstadt. Fourteen Regensburg Jews, all of whom were married to Christians, were deported to Theresienstadt in February 1945. At least 277 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

Reichensachsen,unknown (see below),236 in 1861 (13.6% of the total population),90,"By 1664, five Jewish families had settled in Reichensachsen. Sixteen Jewish households were registered there in 1776, making the community the second largest in the region. By 1861, the Jews of Wichmannshausen (54 in 1861) and Datterode had been affiliated with the Reichensachsen community; Datterode’s Jews remained affiliated with Reichensachsen until 1884/85. The community maintained a synagogue (established in either the 18th or the 19th century), a mikveh and an elementary school, the last of which was located on a street called Herrengasse (or perhaps “Herrenstrasse”) and housed an apartment for the teacher. In 1903, a new synagogue was built on Herrengasse, after which the old house of worship was torn down; damaged by lightning in 1910, the new synagogue was renovated in 1911. We also know that the community maintained a cemetery on Spitzenberg (consecrated in or around the year 1710). In 1933, three Jewish associations (a chevra kadisha, a Gemillut Chassodim charitable society and a women’s association) conducted welfare work in Reichensachsen. A matzo factory (established in 1929) was in business that year. Although we do not know how many children studied religion in 1933, records do tell us that, in 1931/32, a teacher/ chazzan instructed 11 children at the elementary school, which was officially closed in January 1934; schoolchildren from Wichmannshausen attended the Jewish elementary school in Reichensachsen until 1931/32 (no Jews lived in Wichmannshausen in 1932). On Pogrom Night, local residents and/or SA men destroyed the synagogue’s interior, throwing Torah scrolls into a ditch and some of the synagogue’s other contents into the Wehre River. Many local Jews emigrated or moved to other German cities after 1933. Fourteen Jews died in Reichensachsen and 33 were deported. At least 63 Reichensachsen Jews perished in the Shoah, as did five from Wichmannshausen and seven from Datterode. The synagogue building served as a plumber’s workshop until 1954, when it was torn down. A memorial stone was later unveiled on Langenhainer Strasse.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1085,1085
Reinheim,1328,86 in 1900,62,"Reinheim’s modern Jewish community, which was affiliated with the Orthodox rabbinate in Darmstadt, developed in the 18th century. Services were conducted in a prayer room until 1837, when the community built a synagogue—50 seats for men, 32 for women—at 12 Am Biet; the building also housed a mikveh and a school, the latter of which was presided over by teacher Josef Vorenberg from 1887 until 1936. Burials were conducted in Dieburg and, later, in Gross-Bieberau. By 1933, the Jews of Spachbruecken, Georgenhausen and Ueberau had been affiliated with the Rheinheim community. That year, Reinheim Jews still maintained a Jewish association, a sisterhood and a brotherhood. It was in 1933, however, that Jews began to leave Reinheim in considerable numbers; among them was Dr. Goldmann, who left for Frankfurt in 1933 and immigrated to the United States in 1939. In all, 15 local Jews immigrated to the United States, three to Palestine and two to France. The community, warned of impending violence, managed to save the synagogue’s Torah scrolls, which apparently ended up in Darmstadt. On Pogrom Night, SA men destroyed the synagogue’s interior and burned much of its contents in the street; Jewish homes and businesses were razed, and several Jews were severely beaten. According to an eyewitness, one man was hit so hard on the head that he bled profusely. At least 16 Reinheim Jews, eight from Georgenhausen and seven from Spachbruecken perished in the Shoah. In 1945, right before the liberation, inmates at Buchenwald hung the local SS officer who had been responsible for the outrages committed on Pogrom Night. The synagogue building, confiscated after the pogrom, was later used as a shed. A memorial plaque was unveiled there in 1986, and the building was restored in 1990.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: AJ, EJL  www.synagoge-pfungstadt.de/  jwa.org/  www.echo-online.de/  www.reinheim.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1086,1086
Reiskirchen,in our around the year 1700,43 in 1924,36,"The Jewish community of Reiskirchen, which belonged to the liberal provincial rabbinate of Upper Hesse (in the town of Giessen), established a synagogue at 9, Schulgasse in 1886. Reiskirchen Jews were able to maintain their own school for religious studies and a mikveh, but conducted burials in Grossen-Buseck and, later, in Alten-Buseck. The Jews of Ettingshausen (13 in 1924) were members of the Reiskirchen community. In 1933, 36 Jews lived in Reiskirchen. That same year, shots were fired next to Jewish homes. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), Jewish homes were razed; the synagogue was burned down during the pogrom, at noon on November 10, 1938. In the years 1933 to 1939, three local Jews died in Reiskirchen, 10 emigrated and 14 moved to other parts of Germany. Eleven Jews still lived in Reiskirchen in 1939, of whom eight were deported in February 1942.

Remagen,before 1300,64 in 1863,25,"In Remagen, a Jewish community was founded in the 17th or 18th century. Records indicate that the community established a prayer room before 1794. In 1819, another prayer room was opened on the corner of Bachstrasse and Kirchstrasse; this room deteriorated over the years, and in August 1869, the congregation inaugurated a new synagogue. Remagen was also home to a mikveh and two Jewish cemeteries, the older of which was located on Auf der Heide; at the new cemetery, the first burial took place in 1891. Together with the Jews of Sinzig and Niederbreisig, the community maintained a school for religious studies from 1886 until 1895. After 1908, Sinzig, Remagen and Niederzissen jointly employed a teacher of religion who served as chazzan and shochet. From the 1920s onwards, the communities of Loehndorf and Bodendorf were affiliated with the Remagen-Sinzig regional synagogue community. In 1933, 25 Jews lived in Remagen. Their successful handicraft and trade association, which was originally founded as a chevra kadisha in 1837, had been promoting craftwork since 1888. One pupil received religious instruction. On Pogrom Night, SA men broke into the synagogue and burned down the building. The fire brigade intervened to protect the neighboring houses. Later, in May 1939, the synagogue’s ruins were sold to the Koblenz post office. Most local Jews had fled by 1939. Those who stayed were deported in April and July of 1942. At least 26 Remagen Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue’s ruins were torn down in 1944/45, and in 1964 the site was converted into a parking lot. In November 1999, a glasswork memorial in honor of Remagen’s Jews was unveiled at the Roemerplatz, only to be replaced in 2003 by a stone sculpture of the Star of David.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: AJ, EJL, FGW, SG-RHN, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1088,1088
Remscheid,1694,280 (or 273) in 1933,,"The presence of Jews in Remscheid was documented in 1694, but it was only in the 1860s that a functioning Jewish community developed there. Eastern European Jews, many of whom settled in Remscheid during the years 1900 to 1915, made up 50% of the local Jewish population. Members of the mainstream community prayed in Wuppertal-Elberfeld; the Eastern European Jews conducted their own services in Orthodox prayer halls at, among other locations, 161 Freiheitsstrasse and 90a Bismarckstrasse, the latter of which housed murals by local artist Heinrich Mandelbaum. The community maintained a cemetery in the Bliedinghausen district (on Steinacker Strasse), as well as a charity organization and a chevra kadisha. Several Zionist organizations were active in Remscheid by 1933, as was the Jewish sports club Bar Kokhba. Soon after the Nazis’ election victories, the Bismarckstrasse prayer room was closed down as a result of its proximity to local Nazi offices; the room was moved to Bankstrasse. The anti- Jewish boycott was immediately enforced in Remscheid, and many Jews accordingly left town, in response to which HeHalutz, the Zionist association, set up a branch in Remscheid in 1938. In October 1938, Eastern European Jews were expelled to the German-Polish border. One month later, on Pogrom Night, Jewish homes and businesses were vandalized, and five or eight Jews were sent to Dachau. The Bankstrasse prayer hall was destroyed. The deportation of local Jews began in October 1941. At least 63 Jews were deported directly from Remscheid and 23 from occupied Europe. According to some estimates, the number of deported Jews was 170, all of whom perished. Remscheid is no longer home to a Jewish community, nor were memorials ever unveiled at the prayer hall sites.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW  www.remscheid.christ2020.de/  www.beate-wilding.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1089,1089
Rendsburg,1693,292 in 1835,30,"The Jews of Rendsburg established a cemetery in 1695; a prayer room, located in a private house, in 1697; and, by 1712, a prayer hall at 8 Prinzessinstrasse. The prayer hall was deemed unsafe in 1732/33, and although we do not know where local Jews conducted services after the hall closed down, records do tell us that a new synagogue and mikveh were consecrated on the same site in 1845. The community’s Talmud Torah school, established nearby in 1756 and moved to a new building in the 1830s, later became an elementary school; the school limited its curriculum to religious studies in 1892, and in 1900 the building was rented out, after which classes were held in the synagogue. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s Torah Ark was blown up; later, in 1939, the building was forcibly sold to a local company. We also know that the cemetery was sold to a firearms society. Most Jews left Rendsburg, 15 immigrating to other countries. By February 1939, all the town’s Polish Jews had been moved into one building; and in 1942, right before three local Jews were deported to the East, a couple slated for deportation committed suicide. At least 33 Rendsburg Jews perished in the Shoah.

Rexingen,16th century,427 in 1846,262,"The Jewish community of Rexingen was first documented in the 16th century. Large numbers of young Jews remained in Rexingen until the Nazi period, an anomaly in rural Germany. The Rexingen Jewish community established the following institutions: a synagogue in 1710; a community center and cemetery—the 16th-century cemetery was abandoned after a flood—in 1760; a new synagogue, on Freudenstaedterstrasse, in 1837 (renovated during the years 1933 to 1935); and an elementary school, presided over by a teacher who also served as a shochet and chazzan, in 1824. In 1933, 262 Jews lived in Rexingen. Twenty pupils attended the school, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community. The synagogue was vandalized and set on fire on Pogrom Night, but the blaze was extinguished by the fire brigade; its interior and its ritual objects, however, were destroyed. Windows in Jewish homes were smashed, and Jewish men were sent to Dachau. The synagogue building later accommodated a Mauser ammunitions factory. After 1933, 105 Jews moved to Rexingen from other towns; 13 Jewish babies were born there during this period. In February 1938, 38 local Jews immigrated to Palestine, where they founded the community of Shavei Zion. Another 174 Jews subsequently emigrated, 38 died in the town, three committed suicide and 128 were deported, mainly to Riga and to Theresienstadt, in 1941/42. At least 112 Rexingen Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1977, the community center was demolished. The restored synagogue, now a public building, contains a memorial hall.

Rheda-Wiedenbrueck,1576,116 in 1912,92,"The first era of Jewish settlement in Rheda began in 1576 and ended with the expulsion of 1689. Jews returned to Rheda in 1711, and by 1735 eight Jewish families lived there. In 1779, in spite of protests, Jewish court agent and supplier Jakob Moises became a member of the local Chamber of Commerce. Rheda’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1772, soon after which, in 1781, the Jewish community was officially founded. In 1802, prior to which services had been conducted in a prayer room (located in a round, wooden building), the community inaugurated a synagogue in a halftimbered building on Steinweg. Although women sat in a designated balcony, the congregation may have been liberal, as records tell us that a harmonium was used during services. Rheda’s Jewish school, built near the synagogue in 1860, served the community until 1924. On Pogrom Night, SA men congregated in the Neuhaus restaurant, after which they vandalized the synagogue and set the building on fire; Jewish men were sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. The synagogue site was later sold. By September 1939, all but one local Jew had emigrated from or relocated within Germany. Many Rheda Jews, in fact, were deported from other towns and cities in Germany. At least 42 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

In 1780, when nine Jewish families (39 Jews) lived in Rheinbach, the magistrate petitioned to limit the Jewish population to three or four families. Later, in 1843, 60 Jews lived there (total population: 1,597). Communal institutions included a synagogue on Schweigelstrasse (established in 1872) and two cemeteries: the first, in Rheinbach-Wormersdorf, is located on the edge of the woods near Tomburg (three gravestones are still intact); the second, located on present-day Am Juedischem Friedhof (literally “at the Jewish cemetery”), was built near the freight yard. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue on fire and confiscated Torah scrolls and ritual objects. Five Jewish men were arrested and sent to a concentration camp. The synagogue ruins were later torn down. Of the 19 Jews who lived in Rheinbach when World War II broke out, all were sent to the East, via the Bonn-Endenich transit camp, in February 1942.

Rhaunen,1390,104 in 1895,60,"The Jewish community of Rhaunen, although never able to establish a proper synagogue, conducted services in prayer halls set up in private residences.

We also know that the town was home to two Jewish cemeteries, the first of which was consecrated in 1829, the second in 1885. In 1933, 60 Jews lived in Rhaunen. Six children received religious instruction that year, and a women’s association and a men’s charity association were active in the community. Earlier, in 1932, the Jews of Hottenbach and Stipshausen had been affiliated with the Rhaunen community. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; Jewish-owned homes and businesses were looted and damaged, and Jewish men were arrested and sent to the Wittlich prison. The synagogue building was demolished a few days later, after which the property was sold, for much less than its actual value, to a local resident. Most Jews managed to leave Rhaunen. In October 1941, the remaining 17 Jews were deported to the East. At least 20 Rhaunen Jews, 15 Hottenbach Jews and one from Stipshausen perished in the Shoah.

Earlier, at some point during the 16th century, the Jews of Rheinberg and nearby Orsoy had consecrated a cemetery. We also know that in 1764, local Jews built a prayer hall despite the opposition of the local clergy; the last High Holiday service was conducted there in 1936. The community inaugurated a new synagogue (in Orsoy) in 1867, but the population decline of the 1880s—when many congregants left Rheinberg in search of better economic opportunities—meant that both houses of worship were used only intermittently. According to records, the Jewish communities of Rheinberg and Orsoy were affiliated with that of Alpen in the late 19th century. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 met some resistance, as a result of which Adolf Rothschild, a prominent merchant, was taken into “protective custody.” Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), both synagogues were broken into and wrecked. The few remaining Jews were deported in 1941/42, but information about their fate is not available.

The community buried its dead in Kuppenheim, and, after 1830, in Freistett. A small family cemetery was consecrated in the early 19th century; it is the smallest Jewish cemetery in Baden- Wuerttemberg, with one gravestone remaining.

The synagogue, inaugurated at 42, Wilhelm-Strater-Strasse in 1876, also housed a mikveh and a school, the latter of which was established in a wing of the building in 1880. Rheydt’s Jewish school was moved into its own building— where a teacher’s apartment was installed—at the turn of the century, after which, with an enrollment of 60 students, it was officially recognized as a Jewish elementary school. The Rheydt community maintained an old-age home, a hostel for girls and a Chevro Gemillut Hassidim charity organization. A Jewish sisterhood aided the sick, new mothers, youth and the unemployed.

The Jewish population began to dwindle soon after the Nazis’ election victories. In 1935, while leaving the synagogue, Jews were assaulted by hammer-wielding Nazi thugs. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue and its contents— including the Torah scrolls—were set on fire. Private property was razed, and Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald; they were released several weeks later. By March 1, 1939, no Jews lived in Rhina. According to records, 76 local Jews emigrated (50 went to the United States). At least 69 former residents of Rhina perished in the Shoah. The Jewish cemetery in Burghaun contains a memorial to Shoah victims from the district of Huehnfeld (175 in total), among them those from Rhina. The movie “Now . . . After All These Years” is based on the autobiography of a former Rhina resident.","Esther Sarah Evans Sources: AJ, EJL www.rhina.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1101,1101
Ribnitz,mid-1400s,92 in 1867,17,"The Jewish population of Ribnitz never exceeded 92, as municipal regulations made it quite difficult for Jews to thrive there. The Ribnitz authorities not only limited Jews to a narrow range of professions, but also restricted the districts in which they could conduct business. This small Jewish community conducted religious services in a private residence until 1830, when the authorities gave permission for the consecration of a Jewish cemetery and the purchase of a small, old, poorly constructed building for use as a synagogue. The synagogue was closed in 1935, by which point the congregation had dwindled significantly. Although only 10 Jews lived in Ribnitz in 1935, large anti-Jewish demonstrations took place in the town. On Pogrom Night, the abandoned synagogue was burned down and the cemetery was desecrated. The cemetery contains a small memorial plaque.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1103,1103
Richelsdorf,,63 in 1871 (10.6% of the total population),40-45,"Richelsdorf is now part of Wildeck, in the district of Hersfeld- Rotenburg, Fulda. Records indicate that Richelsdorf ’s synagogue on In der Steinkaute (between the Gebhardt and Burghardt family homes) was established in 1880 or 1881; the mikveh was located in the basement. Burials were conducted in Sontra until 1880, soon after which, in 1881, the Jews of Richelsdorf consecrated their own cemetery (it was ravaged in 1927). The community, which likely belonged to the rabbinate of Lower Hesse, headquartered in the city Kassel, never established a Jewish school. The last leader of the community was Josef Loewenstein; his father, Ruben (who died in 1926), had led the community for more than 25 years. On Pogrom Night, rioters ravaged the synagogue and threw the Torah scrolls onto the street. The Jewish community was dissolved in 1938, after which the 19 remaining Jews either emigrated or relocated within Germany. The last to leave was Max Eichhorn, who perished in Dachau at the age of 57. Two Richelsdorf Jews were deported in 1942. According to Yad Vashem, five Richelsdorf Jews perished in the Shoah, but other records suggest that the number was higher. Max Falkenstein, of Richelsdorf, left Germany on the MSS St. Louis, which was denied entry in Havana and forced to return to Europe; Falkenstein, however, survived the war. The synagogue was torn down in 1950 (or possibly in the 1960s); a considerable number of ritual objects were discovered there. At the cemetery, 35 gravestones are still intact.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-HNF, YV  www.richelsdorf.de/  www.goethe.de/  resources.ushmm.org/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1104,1104
Rhoden-Wrexen,1765,68 in 1826,60,"The small neighboring villages of Rhoden and Wrexen established a joint Jewish community on an unspecified date. In the late 1800s, the community built a synagogue, established a school for religious studies, consecrated a cemetery and employed a teacher who also served as cantor and shochet. The efficiency with which the Jewish community functioned was still evident in 1933, when the entire membership of the Rhoden’s branch of the Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers participated in the funeral of Josef Stern, who had been president of the Jewish community. However, the political climate deteriorated soon afterwards, and in 1935, as a result of emigration, the community began to dwindle. On Pogrom Night, Nazi troops broke into Jewish homes and assaulted the residents. The synagogue, which had been ravaged and set on fire, was no more than a pile of rubble by the following morning. Rhoden-Wrexen’s remaining Jews were deported to the camps in 1942.

Rieneck,Middle Ages,96 in 1837,19,"The earliest record of Jewish Rieneck refers to the anti- Jewish Rindfleisch massacres of 1298. Although Jews were expelled from the town in 1618, a new Jewish presence was re-established there in 1669. We know that a synagogue had been established in Rieneck by the end of the 17th century, because its Torah Ark bore an inscription dated 1748. In 1790, a Talmud Torah school for boys was active in the town. The synagogue was renovated in 1872, and a separate school building—it housed the mikveh—was built in 1873. The community buried its dead in Altengronau (in the region of Hesse). In 1933, a teacher from Adelsberg instructed several Jewish schoolchildren. As a prelude to Pogrom Night, the synagogue was broken into and desecrated on June 30, 1937, when six Torah scrolls were removed from the Torah Ark and thrown on the floor. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was destroyed along with its furniture, ritual items and other contents; Jewish homes were heavily damaged that night. Four Rieneck Jews emigrated and two relocated within Germany. The 13 who remained after the pogrom were forced to sell their homes in February 1939; by March 10, 1939, all had moved to Frankfurt am Main. At least seven Rieneck Jews perished in the Shoah.

Individual Jews lived in Riesenburg in the early 1700s, but it was not until the early 1800s that a Jewish community was established there. Local Jews consecrated a cemetery and established a synagogue, the latter of which was of neo- Gothic design, in 1812 and 1855, respectively. (The cemetery was in use until 1930.) Jews began to flee Riesenburg soon after the Nazis rose to power, so that by 1937 only 65 Jews lived in the town. On Pogrom Night, Nazis stormed the synagogue and burned it down. The Jewish cemetery was destroyed during the war, and is now a garage. One can find fragments of gravestones bearing Hebrew and German inscriptions scattered among the trees and the grass of the cemetery site.

Rimbeck,mid-1500s,72 in 1885,unknown (54 in 1932),"Rimbeck’s synagogue, named Im Hagebrunnen, was built in Heinrich Blasé’s garden in 1853, when the Rimbeck Jewish community separated from that of nearby Ossendorf. It was not, however, until 1875 that the synagogue became property of the Jewish community; as its steps were located on municipal land, taxes were paid to the municipality accordingly. That same year, the Jews of Rimbeck consecrated a cemetery. The synagogue was renovated in 1928. In 1932/33, the community leaders were D. Dannenbaum and L. Cohn Warburg. Rimbeck’s affiliated Jewish communities were Ossendorf and Bonenburg. The synagogue was damaged and vandalized on Pogrom Night; an eyewitness who was 10 years old at the time said that the building was set on fire. Records also tell us that Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald, that a young girl was raped, and that local youths smashed windows in Jewish-owned businesses (Vorreuther’s establishment was destroyed). Rose Meyer recalled how she and her family were dragged out of their house and assaulted by townspeople, after which they were the victims of relentless persecution. Rose Meyer’s father died in 1941, after his family had been forcibly relocated. The synagogue ruins were demolished in 1940. Later, in December of 1941 and July of 1942, the town’s remaining Jews were deported to the Riga Ghetto. At least 38 Jews from Rimbeck perished in the Shoah.

Rimbach,in or around the year 1648,232 in 1861 (13.6% of the total population),,"The Jewish community of Rimbach, founded in or around the year 1774, established its first synagogue in approximately 1774; a new synagogue (with 120 seats for men and 84 for women) on the corner of Schlossstrasse and Heinzenwiesenweg in 1840; a mikveh in 1826; an elementary school at some point before 1821; and a cemetery in 1849. After the school closed, the community employed a teacher of religion who also served as chazzan and shochet. In 1933, nine schoolchildren studied religion in Rimbach under the supervision of a teacher from Viernheim. Several local Jews were sent to the Osthofen concentration camp that year. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; Jewish homes and businesses were attacked that night, and Jews were assaulted. The remaining Jews were later forced to sell the synagogue for far less than its actual value, after which it was converted into a storeroom for firefighting equipment. The community was disbanded in 1939. In August 1941, all remaining Jews were moved into two “Jews’ houses.” Forty Jews emigrated, 21 relocated within Germany, 11 passed away and one committed suicide. In 1942, four Jews were deported to Poland and five to Theresienstadt. At least 55 Rimbach Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1952/53, the synagogue was converted into a Catholic church, to which a memorial plaque was later affixed.

Rimpar,1577,142 in 1867,54,"In 1792, the Jewish community of Rimpar inaugurated a synagogue on the Judenplatz, or “Jews’ square”, (later renamed Marktplatz); the synagogue, damaged in the anti- Jewish Hep-Hep riots of 1819, was renovated and enlarged in 1852. Local Jews were able to maintain a community center (it housed a classroom and a mikveh) but buried their dead in Schwanfeld. Three brothers of the Lehman family (natives of Rimpar) immigrated to the United States in the 1840s; their descendants later founded Lehman Brothers, the international investment bank. In 1933, a Jewish teacher/chazzan instructed 11 pupils in religion. A chevra kadisha and a Jewish women’s association were active in the town that year. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s furniture and ritual items were destroyed; local Jews were assaulted that night. Twenty-three Rimpar Jews left Germany (all but one immigrated to the United States) and 14 relocated within the country. Of the nine Jews who still lived in Rimpar in 1942, six were deported to Izbica, via Wuerzburg, in April of that year; the last three were sent to Wuerzburg’s Jewish old-age home in July 1942, and deported to Theresienstadt in September. At least 16 Rimpar Jews perished in the Shoah. The Rimpar synagogue was later used as a warehouse.

Rinteln,1580s,80 in 1905,73,"In Rinteln, most Jews earned a living as pawnbrokers, moneylenders, cattle traders or merchants. Services were conducted in private residences until 1848, when the community inaugurated a synagogue on Brennerstrasse, in the Katz family home. The house of worship was moved to the rear of a community-owned building in 1917; the building was sold in 1921, after which the community rented the premises. We also know that, in 1848, the Jews of Rinteln replaced their 16th-century cemetery with new burial grounds on Ostertorstrasse. A Jewish school was established in Rinteln at some point during the 19th century. In 1899, however, Jewish children started attending the local school, where a Jewish teacher instructed them in religious studies. The 19th-century community was not only active in local politics, but also maintained a Jewish youth organization and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith. Anti-Jewish measures, enjoying the full support of the mayor, were implemented in Rinteln immediately after the Nazis’ election victories in 1933. Many local Jews emigrated or relocated within Germany during the following years, and in 1936 the synagogue was moved to another private residence (on the same street). On Pogrom Night, rioters plundered Jewish homes, desecrated the cemetery, vandalized the synagogue and set ritual objects on fire. Jewish men were arrested. Later, in 1941, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into a designated house. Rinteln’s last Jews were deported during the years 1942 to 1944. At least 31 local Jews died in the Shoah.

A prayer hall was established in Rockenhausen at some point during the 18th century, and another was opened in a private residence in 1811. Finally, in 1885, the Jews of Rockenhausen inaugurated a synagogue at 1 Gutenbrunnenstrasse; the synagogue accommodated 60 men, 35 women, a schoolroom and an apartment for a teacher. Other communal institutions included a Jewish public school (later a school for religious studies); a mikveh; an 18thcentury cemetery (enlarged in 1842); and a new cemetery (consecrated in 1908/12). In 1933, six children received religious instruction. A women’s association was active in the community, with which the Jews of Dielkirchen and Marienthal were affiliated. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the interior of the synagogue was destroyed; Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Seventeen Jews emigrated, 37 relocated within Germany and nine were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 22 Rockenhausen Jews perished in the Shoah.

The community, largely middle class, was home to many businessmen—one Rosenberg Jew owned a distillery—and professionals. The anti-Jewish boycott of 1933 did not initially affect the Jews of Rosenberg, as the region was then protected by the League of Nations’ convention on minority rights. In 1934, a Zionist training kibbutz, called the Yom Tov kibbutz, was set up in Rosenberg. On Pogrom Night, Jewish-owned homes were vandalized and the synagogue was burned down. Several ritual objects were saved, however, and a Jewish survivor even managed to transfer a Torah scroll to the Philippines.

Rostock,1279,360 in 1933,360,"Rostock was founded in the mid-1200s by merchants— many of whom were Jewish—who wanted it to become a center of trade and commerce. According to records, these early Rostock Jews established a cemetery (unknown date of construction) and, in 1348, an official Jewish community. The community was short-lived, however, for Jews were expelled from Rostock after the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. It was not until 1868 that another Jewish presence was recorded in Rostock. Services were held in private homes until 1902, when, with funds donated by a wealthy local Jew, the community purchased a plot of land and built a synagogue, the largest in Mecklenburg (350 seats). Differences between its orthodox and liberal factions nearly split the community, but in the end, after concessions from both sides, the community decided to continue using the more conservative synagogue traditions. Many members of Rostock’s modern Jewish community suffered anti-Semitic persecution in 1919, when the University of Rostock celebrated its 500th anniversary. Speaker after speaker at the event blamed the Jews for Germany’s woes and her defeat in World War I. Jewish students were eventually expelled from the university, and the contracts of all Jewish instructors were terminated. Local residents zealously enforced the Nazis’ anti-Jewish boycott of 1933. Accordingly, only 175 Jews remained in Rostock by 1938. On Pogrom Night, holy books and ritual articles from the synagogue were thrown onto the street and set on fire, after which the building was burned to the ground; the fire blazed for 24 hours. Today, the site accommodates an apartment building, next to which a small memorial plaque has been unveiled.

Renovated and re-inaugurated in 1924, the synagogue also housed a Jewish elementary school, which was at one point the largest of its kind in the Kurhesse province (with 70 pupils and two teachers); after 1913, however, the school limited its curriculum to religious studies. We also know that the community maintained a mikveh on Brauhausstrasse and a cemetery at Katzenkopf. In Rotenburg, a pogrom erupted in 1848; the violence was so intense that the town had to send for a troop of 300 armed men to restore order. On March 30, 1933, Jewish-owned stores were vandalized and damaged; that same year, the Schloss Park was renamed Adolf Hitler Park. Many Jews left Rotenburg during the years that followed. On Pogrom Night, SA men vandalized the synagogue and destroyed its interior. The violence, which was referred to as an “Aktion” (“mission”) also included the destruction of Jewish apartments. Most of the remaining Jews left Rotenburg after the pogrom; and in 1940, the town was declared “Judenrein,” or “cleansed of Jews.” Rotenburg is no longer home to a Jewish community. Memorial plaques have been unveiled next to the former synagogue, to the Jewish school and to the mikveh. Memorial stumbling stones commemorate the community.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, SG-H, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1121,1121
Rotenburg an der Fulda,1200,300 in 1900,unknown,"Jews lived in Rotenburg an der Fulda since its founding in approximately 1200. The Jewish community was massacred during the Black Death pogroms of 1348, and it was not until 350 years later that another was established in Rotenburg. In 1731, 133 Jews lived in Rotenburg. The community established a synagogue in 1738—restored in 1923 and inaugurated in 1924—and a cemetery in 1740. By the end of the 18th century, 200 Jews lived in Rotenburg. Members of this community were required, on the basis of an old ordinance, to give the local church leader a silver spoon once every year. Rotenburg was also home to a district rabbinate and, during the years 1826 to 1913, a Jewish elementary school. (The school offered religious studies only after 1913.) In 1848, a time of great economic distress in the region, the local populace vandalized Jewish property and smashed store windows. Similar violence erupted in Rotenburg soon after the Nazis came to power in 1933. On Pogrom Night, November 1938, Jewish homes and businesses were destroyed; the synagogue was desecrated (its windows smashed, its ritual objects destroyed). The synagogue building was leveled in 1947, after which a memorial stone, commemorating the destroyed school and synagogue, was erected at the site.","Fred Gottlieb  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1122,1122
Roth bei Nuremberg,1414,200 in 1837,19,"Although the earliest record of a Jewish presence in Roth bei Nuremberg is dated 1414, Jews may have lived there in the 14th century. The Jewish community established its first prayer room (possibly a synagogue) in the 17th century; and in 1737, a synagogue was built on the Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley,” (present-day 44 Kugelbuehlstrasse). Burials were conducted in Baiersdorf and, later, in Georgensgmuend. The Jews of Roth maintained a mikveh and a community center, the latter of which housed a Jewish elementary and school for religious studies. In 1924, the teacher/shochet from nearby Thalmaessing traveled regularly to Roth to instruct children in religion. By December 1935, as a result of rabid anti-Semitism and boycotts of Jewish businesses in which local schoolchildren participated by putting up posters, all Jews had left Roth The town was then declared Judenfrei (“free of Jews”), after which the synagogue’s interior was ransacked. At least nine Roth Jews perished in the Shoah. During the years 1945 to 1948, approximately 16 Shoah survivors lived in Roth. The synagogue was converted into an office building after 1945 and, later, used as a youth center. A model of the former synagogue, created by the Schloss Cronheim therapy center, is on display at the municipal museum.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1124,1124
Roth,1611,45 in 1900,32 (six families),"On the basis of the prince-elector’s legislation on community affairs (dated December 30, 1823), the Jews of Roth, Fronhausen and Lohra were able to form a synagogue community in Roth. In 1861, the combined Jewish population of the three towns was 101. Fronhausen and Lohra left the synagogue community in 1880. In 1832, after the synagogue in Roth burned down, the community built a new house of worship. Records from 1883 tell us that the new synagogue had its own seal— intertwined twigs—and two Torah scrolls. The synagogue was renovated on several occasions: in 1916, for example, the annex was rebuilt. The community also maintained a cemetery, a mikveh (located in the synagogue’s annex) and a school for religious studies, the last of which was often periodically shut down for lack of qualified teachers; after 1882, Jewish children attended the town’s public school. At the Jewish cemetery, the oldest gravestone is dated 1816; Jewish burials were conducted in Marburg from 1939 onwards. From early 1936 until July 1938, the Jewish population dropped from 29 to 13. On November 8, 1938 (one day before Pogrom Night) the synagogue’s windows, interior and Judaica were destroyed. Later, on February 9, 1939, the synagogue was forcibly sold to a cabinet maker and a farmer, after which the site was used for storing lumber. The cemetery was closed in 1940; in 1941, a section of the burial ground was sold to neighboring residents, and in December 1942, a representative of the Jewish community in Frankfurt sold another section to residents of Roth. Seven Roth Jews immigrated to the United States or South Africa. Nineteen Neustadt Jews were brought to Roth in the spring of 1941, so that the Jewish population for October 28, 1941 was 28. Nine local Jews were deported to Theresienstadt in 1941 and on September 9, 1942—all nine perished there. At least 29 Roth Jews were murdered in in the Shoah. At the initiative of an American soldier, the cemetery was restored by 1949; a memorial plaque was later unveiled there. Memorial stones were also erected in honor of the Stern and Hoechster families. Roth’s synagogue, which was restored in 1990 and opened to the public in August 2008, bears a commemorative plaque.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, PK-HNF, YV  archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/  www.landsynagoge.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1123,1123
Rothenburg ob der Tauber,1119,115 in 1900,45,"Rothenburg’s 12th-century Jewish community maintained a synagogue, a school and a mikveh. A large yeshiva was established in Rothenburg in the 13th century, and we also know that Rabbi Meir ben Baruch (the maharam of Rothenburg and a prominent leader of German Jewry) resided there from 1250 until 1286. Local Jews were killed during the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298; later, during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, the community was annihilated, after which the synagogue was converted into a church. Jews returned to Rothenburg in the mid-14th century, establishing a Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”), a cemetery, a synagogue (1407) and a mikveh. This community was expelled in 1397, as was another in 1519/20. It was not until 1870 that another Jewish presence was established in Rothenburg. The modern community opened a prayer hall in 1875 and a synagogue in 1888, the latter of which included an apartment for a teacher and a schoolroom; Moses Hofmann, the community’s first teacher, held that post from 1875 until 1926. Other communal institutions included a cemetery (consecrated in 1890) and a mikveh. In 1933, seven Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction. Three Jewish associations were active in the Rothenburg community that year. From 1933 until 1938, two local Jews emigrated, three passed away in Rothenburg and 23 relocated to other towns in Germany. On October 22, 1938, the remaining 17 Jews were dragged from their homes and expelled from the town, shortly after which the synagogue’s interior was destroyed. At least 26 Rothenburg Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was eventually converted into a residence; the cemetery, which had been destroyed during the Nazi period, was later restored. A memorial plaque (unveiled in 2002) and a museum commemorate Rothenburg’s modern and medieval Jewish communities, respectively.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, PK-BAV  www.alt-rothenburg.de",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1125,1125
Rottweil,14th century,134 in 1880,96,"Rottweil’s medieval Jewish community was annihilated in the Black Death pogroms of 1349, and it was not until the 18th century that a new Jewish presence was established there. Initially affiliated with Muehringen, the Rottweil Jewish community became independent in 1924. The modern community congregated in prayer halls until 1861, when a synagogue and school were built on Kameralamtsgasse; the school was presided over by a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Rottweil in 1850. In 1933, nine Jewish schoolchildren studied religion in Rottweil. Two charitable organizations, a women’s association and a youth association were active in the town. The community was disbanded in the summer of 1938. On Pogrom Night, Jewish property was vandalized and destroyed, as were the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects. The building was sold to a local merchant in December of that year. Fifty-one local Jews emigrated, 36 relocated within Germany, seven died in Rottweil and four were deported to the East in 1942. At least 12 Rottweil Jews perished in the Shoah. The cemetery houses a memorial stone (1966) and a plaque (1990). Another plaque was affixed to the synagogue building in 1979.

Ruchheim (City of Ludwigshafen),17th century,160 in 1852 (15% of the total population),12,"During the 17th century, Ruchheim Jews were members of the Jewish community in nearby Fussgoenheim, which is where Ruchheim’s modern Jewish community, founded in 1859, buried its dead. Ruchheim was home to a synagogue or a prayer room in the 18th century. The community maintained a synagogue, located in a private residence, in the mid-19th century, after which, in 1862, a new synagogue was inaugurated at 52 Fussgoenheimer Strasse; this synagogue soon fell into disrepair, and was accordingly rebuilt in 1881 to accommodate 60 seats for men, 35 for women, a schoolroom and a teacher’s apartment. We also know that the community maintained a mikveh and, from 1836 until 1907, a Jewish public school. Beginning in 1907, schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from Ludwigshafen. In Ruchheim, a community official performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, 12 Jews lived in Ruchheim. Nevertheless, the community held on to its synagogue even after it could no longer gather 10 men for a minyan. On Pogrom Night, axewielding rioters destroyed the interior of the synagogue; ritual objects and books were taken outside and burned. Most Jews managed to leave Ruchheim before the deportations. The village’s last Jews, a married couple named Jakob and Klara Leva, were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 24 Ruchheim Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was later turned into a Protestant community center. A commemorative plaque was unveiled there in 1985; in 2008, several memorial stumbling stones were affixed to the ground.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1127,1127
Rueckingen,1465,46 in 1871,26,"Rueckingen’s synagogue, located below the water citadel on what was then called Muehlenweg (present-day An der Wasserburg), was established in the 18th century; a mikveh was attached to the building. Jews from Rodenbach and Langendiebach attended synagogue services in Rueckingen, and we also know that those from Niederrodenbach (see below) belonged to Rueckingen’s synagogue community. In May 1932, German youths wrecked Rueckingen’s modern Jewish cemetery (they were never caught). Later, on November 11, 1938 (two days after Pogrom Night) SA men demolished the interior of the synagogue, throwing out its ritual objects and burning them in a nearby meadow. Two newspaper reporters claimed to have seen signs of fire damage on the synagogue’s floor, but records indicate that the building was not burned down out of concern for the safety of neighboring structures. The synagogue was torn down in or around 1942. At least 17 Jewish residents of Rueckingen, including Ludwig Gernsheimer, the last leader of Rueckingen’s Jewish community, perished in the Shoah. At the cemetery, where the last burial took place at some point after 1945, there are 15 extant gravestones. In November 1986, a memorial plaque was affixed to a surviving section of the water citadel. About the Niederrodenbach Jews (see above), we know the following: in 1933, 25 Jews lived in Niederrodenbach, including the town’s first doctor, Dr. Julius Blumenthal. Most of them were deported to the East: the four members of Dr. Blumenthal’s family perished in Auschwitz; three others were sent to Lublin, six to Theresienstadt and four to Hungary— they all perished.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, PK-HNF, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1128,1128
Ruelzheim,1667,484 in 1857 (16% of the total population),172,"The Jewish community of Ruelzheim, which peaked at 484 members in 1857, was then the second largest Jewish community in the Speyer bishopric and one of the few in the Palatinate to have a mohel. Earlier, in 1832/33, a synagogue was built on the Kuntzengasse; the roof was renovated in 1867, and the building was enlarged at the end of the 19th century. Other communal institutions included the following: a mikveh (unknown date of construction), a regional cemetery (1826), an elementary school (1830/31) and a library. In 1856, 100 students attended the elementary school. In 1933, the community, with which the Jews of Kandel were affiliated, not only employed a teacher (he instructed 14 students that year) and a chazzan, but also maintained several Jewish associations. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and set the roof on fire; Torah scrolls, ritual objects, rugs and lamps were burned in the backyard. Jewishowned homes and businesses were wrecked and looted, the cemetery was desecrated and Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Beginning in 1930, 75 Ruelzheim Jews emigrated and 88 relocated within Germany (75 in 1938/39). At least 96 Ruelzheim Jews and four from Kandel perished in the Shoah.

Ruedesheim am Rhein,1096,109 in 1874,33,"Jews from Mainz, fleeing the ravages of the First Crusade, arrived in Ruedesheim in 1096; once there, however, they were murdered—some committed suicide—for refusing to convert to Christianity. A new Jewish presence was established in Ruedesheim towards the end of the 17th century, and the community grew as Jews were granted more civil rights. Inaugurated in 1842, the community’s synagogue—it seated 70 worshipers—also served Jews from the surrounding villages. By 1874, at which point the community recorded its peak membership figure, Jews were well integrated among the population of this provincial town. Community membership diminished after World War I, and by 1937 only three Jewish families still lived in Ruedesheim. On November 11, 1938 (two days after Pogrom Night) thugs from neighboring towns demolished the synagogue and the remaining Jewish-owned businesses and residences.

During the 19th century, the following Jewish communities belonged to Ruesselsheim: Bauschheim, Bischofsheim (until 1826), Koenigstaedten (until approximately 1830), Ginsheim (until 1826) and Raunheim. It was only Raunheim, however, that remained affiliated with Ruesselsheim in the 20th century. Records from 1822 mention a synagogue. The Ruesselsheim Jewish community built a new house of worship on Mainzer Strasse in 1844/45 (renovated in 1895 and again in 1928/29); the building accommodated a schoolroom and a mikveh, the latter of which was renovated in 1901. Burials were conducted in Gross- Gerau until 1923, when a Jewish cemetery was consecrated inside the town’s general burial grounds. In 1933, the community ran a Jewish war veterans’ association. Later, on Pogrom Night, November 1938, SA men destroyed the synagogue’s door and interior, burned Torah scrolls and ritual items on the banks of the Main River and vandalized the teacher’s apartment. The synagogue passed into private ownership after the pogrom. During the years 1933 to 1939, many local Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany. Ruesselsheim’s remaining Jews were eventually forced into a so-called “Jews’ house” on Schaefergasse. Several committed suicide, and six were deported in 1942. At least 42 Ruesselsheim Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1945, only one Jew, a woman, still lived in Ruesselsheim. Ownership of the synagogue changed several times before 2005, when a housing association purchased the building, renovated it (2006) and established the Alte Synagoge Foundation (“Old Synagogue Foundation”) in 2008.

Later, as the Jewish community of Ruppichteroth started to grow, the Jews there established their own chevra kadisha and prayer room, the latter of which was located in a private residence. We also know that the community maintained its own synagogue—a twostory building on Wilhelmstrasse—after 1920, and that a cemetery was consecrated on Herchener Strasse in the late 1920s. In November 1938, local residents and SS men from Oberber set the Ruppichteroth synagogue on fire, after which the fire department attempted to extinguish the blaze. On November 15, 1938, Gustav Gaertner was ordered to close the synagogue, and a Jew was forced to remove the Star of David from its roof. The property was appropriated by a local farmer some months later. In 1941/42, Ruppichteroth’s remaining Jews (approximately 15) were deported, via Cologne, to the East.

Saarbruecken,1321 (see below),unknown,"2,400","The first Jewish presence to be recorded in this area was in St. Johann, near Saarbruecken, in 1321. It was only during the 1760s, however, that Jews moved to Saarbruecken in significant numbers. In 1825, a Jewish school for religious studies, presided over by a teacher/chazzan, was established in Saarbruecken. In 1927, three teachers supervised seven classes; and in 1932, 209 pupils attended the school (then offering five classes) for four hours each week. The Jews of Saarbruecken consecrated three cemeteries: in 1840, 1845 and 1919, respectively. Records from 1860 mention the existence of a prayer hall on Talstrasse, and the growing community moved to several larger prayer halls in the course of the late 19th century. In 1888, after much deliberation, the community decided to build a synagogue in St. Johann; construction commenced that year and, in November 1890, the community inaugurated a new synagogue whose congregation was liberal in orientation. The smaller Orthodox community, founded during the Weimer period by Jews from Eastern Europe, maintained their own synagogue and, after 1932, a mikveh. A community center with a weekday prayer room was opened in 1919, and it was there that the Orthodox congregation held its High Holiday services, while the liberal congregation, unable to accommodate the large High Holiday crowds in its synagogue, rented an additional prayer hall for that purpose. In 1933, approximately 2,400 Jews lived in Saarbruecken. The rabbi was Dr. Solomon Ruelf, and, after his emigration in 1934, Dr. Rotschild. Three hundred and ten pupils studied religion, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations were active in the community. In 1934, a Jewish elementary school was opened in Saarbruecken. Although most Jews left Saarbruecken after the Saarland region was returned to Germany in 1935, this community was the only one still officially functioning in the Saarland in 1936. Rabbi Rotschild continued to serve all Jews in the region until his emigration from Germany in 1938. On November 8, 1938 (one day before Pogrom Night), Nazis destroyed the synagogue’s furniture and lamps. The synagogue was invaded three times on Pogrom Night itself; its ritual objects and interior were destroyed, after which the building was burned to the ground. Between 130 and 150 Jewish men were taken from their homes and marched through town to the accompanying cheers and blows of a mob. Some were released the next day, but most were sent to Dachau after having swastikas painted on their faces. When war broke out in 1939, Saarbruecken’s remaining Jews were sent to work camps. At least 299 Saarbruecken Jews perished in the Shoah. The city’s two Jewish cemeteries were desecrated during the war. A new Jewish community in Saarbruecken, founded in 1946, inaugurated a synagogue (with 430 seats) on Beethovenplatz in 1951. Later, in 1978, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site.","Nurit Borut  Sources: DGJS, DNPS, DZG, EJL, FJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1136,1136
Saarlouis,1685,480 in 1925,364,"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Saarlouis is dated 1685. Although many of the town’s Jewish-owned business were attacked and severely damaged after the decision was made (in 1919) to place the Saarland region under the auspices of the League of Nations, Saarlouis’ Jewish community continued to grow and peaked in 1925. Jews conducted services in prayer rooms until 1828, when the community inaugurated a synagogue, with a mikveh and an elementary school, on Silberherzstrasse (Postgaesschen). The school was closed in 1875, after which the community employed a teacher/chazzan; another functionary served as shochet and as an aide to the chazzan. Saarlouis’ Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1905, and we also know that the synagogue was renovated in 1878 and again in 1915. In 1933, 364 Jews lived in Saarlouis and the nearby villages; several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community that year. Most Jews left Saarlouis after the Saarland was returned to Germany in March 1935. On Pogrom Night, the five remaining Jewishowned businesses were destroyed and looted, as was the synagogue’s interior. Several Jews were assaulted that night. In September 1939, Saarlouis’ remaining 18 Jews were forced to leave the town: 15 emigrated from Germany; three were deported to the Gurs concentration camp on October 22, 1940. Saarlouis’ Jewish cemetery, severely damaged during the war, is now a memorial site. The synagogue building—it served as a carpenter’s shop at some point—was converted into a church in 1968. In 1986, three years after the structure was demolished, a new building was erected on the site; inside, a memorial room was built in honor of the destroyed Jewish community and its former synagogue.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AJ, EJL  www.saarlouis.de",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1138,1138
Saarwellingen,1671,191 in 1895,134,"The Jews of Saarwellingen conducted services in a prayer room, first mentioned in records from 1771, until 1832, when a synagogue was inaugurated at 10 Engelstrasse (construction commenced in 1829). The community also maintained an elementary school (which became a public Jewish school in 1891), a mikveh and a cemetery. Saarwellingen’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1725, desecrated in 1884 and enlarged in 1920. Sixteen children attended the school in 1933. In 1935, after the Saar region was annexed to Germany, many Jews left Saarwellingen (63 emigrated). On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed, Jewish homes were vandalized and Jews were assaulted. A few days later, Jews were loaded onto a bus and sent to the French border, where they were refused entry by the French authorities. Saarwellingen’s remaining Jews were forcibly moved into one house from which, on October 22, 1940, they were deported to Gurs concentration camp, in France. At least 66 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue—the municipality appropriated the building after Pogrom Night—was damaged severely during the war; a residential building, built during the years 1951 to 1954, now stands on synagogue’s original foundations. In 2002, the former Jewish school (a memorial plaque is affixed to the building) was named Leo Gruenfeld House, after a Jewish teacher who perished in Auschwitz. Saarwellingen’s Jewish cemetery, which had been leveled at the end of the war, was later partially restored.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, DGJS, EJL",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1139,1139
Sachsenhagen,early 17th century,58 in 1885,22,"In 1885, when this small Jewish community recorded its peak population figure, most Sachsenhagen Jews were cattle traders, butchers and merchants. By the mid-1700s, the community had established a prayer room (located in a private residence) and a burial site. The earliest records of a proper synagogue and a cemetery, the latter of which was located at the Duehlholzgaerten, are dated 1823 and 1835, respectively. Sachsenhagen was home to a Jewish school from 1859 to 1889, but the teacher was frequently replaced, and there was no chazzan or shochet during those years. In 1870, the community finally inaugurated a synagogue; the building also housed a school whose teacher may have served as shochet and chazzan. Several local Jews were active in the town’s social and political life. In response to the increasingly dire political situation, many Jews left Sachsenhagen after 1933. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), three Jews were arrested. Although the synagogue was not burned down that night (so as not to damage neighboring buildings), rioters destroyed its windows and interior. The synagogue building was used as a barn until 1967, when it was converted into a residential building. At least 21 Sachsenhagen Jews perished in the Shoah.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, JGNB1  www.schaumburgerlandschaft.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1140,1140

By 1863, the Jewish population had peaked at 67 (10% of the total population). Local Jews were members of the Andernach synagogue community from 1866 until 1878. In 1858, the Saffig Jewish community built a synagogue at 3 Kloeppelsberg (present-day Neustrasse). Burials were conducted at the Jewish cemetery in Meisenheim. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA troops destroyed the interior of Saffig’s synagogue, broke its windows and burned most of its ritual objects; one Torah scroll and one Megillat Esther (Book of Esther) scroll were saved, and are now kept in New York and Sydney, respectively. In December 1939, the community was forced to sell the synagogue for 270 Reichsmarks, after which the site was used as a shed for storing tools and other equipment. In 1942, Saffig’s remaining Jews were deported. At least six former Jewish residents of Saffig perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was declared a historical monument in 1984.

Sagan,approximately 12th-13th century,170 in 1880,78,"Jews settled in Sagan (Polish: Żagań), in Lower Silesia, probably during the 12th or the 13th century. By the mid- 14th century, most were living on the Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley,” (present-day Słowackiego). In 1462, after a series of pogroms, Duke Jan II (Żagań’s last ruler from the Piast dynasty) expelled Jews from Sagan. It was not until the 19th century that a new Jewish community was established there, peaking at 170 members in 1880. In 1813, the community consecrated a cemetery on Heideberg, later moving it to Lessingstrasse (present-day Berka Joselewicza). We also know that in 1857, local Jews purchased the town arsenal building, located in the medieval bastion, for use as a synagogue. Sagan’s Jewish population figures for 1933, 1937 and 1939 are, respectively, 78, 30 and seven. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was set on fire and Jewishowned businesses were destroyed. Additional information about the community’s fate during the Nazi period is not available, but Yad Vashem lists the name of a Sagan Jew, Moise Reifman, who was killed in Auschwitz. A memorial plaque was never erected next to the former synagogue or cemetery, and Sagan is no longer home to a Jewish community.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, FJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1142,1142
Salzhemmendorf,late 17th century,30 in 1885,6,"The Jewish community of Salzhemmendorf, established in 1843, included Jews from several neighboring communities. In 1885, when this tiny community recorded its peak population figure, most local Jews were cattle dealers, horse dealers or peddlers. Salzhemmendorf ’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Limberger Strasse in 1810. (Most of the neighboring communities maintained their own prayer rooms and cemeteries.) In 1848, the Salzhemmendorf Jewish community replaced an older prayer room (located in a private residence) with a synagogue on the upper floor of a residence on Kampstrasse; the building also housed a mikveh, a school and an apartment for a teacher. We also know that in 1868, the community’s chevra kadisha was dissolved. In 1933, six Jews still lived in Salzhemmendorf (there were similar numbers in the associated communities). As a result of intensifying persecution and boycotts, many of Jews left during the following years. On Pogrom Night, Jewish properties were vandalized and looted. Although the mayor prevented the synagogue being set on fire, the building’s interior and windows were destroyed by members of the SA and SS. In 1938/39, the building was sold to a farmer who used it as a pigsty. The remaining Jews were deported to camps in the early 1940s. At least eight Jews from Salzhemmendorf and from the surrounding communities died in the Shoah.

Salzwedel,early 14th century,103 in 1840,64,"It was not until the early 19th century that a continuous Jewish presence was established in Salzwedel. The community’s prayer room—it was located in a private residence—was destroyed by fire in 1856. Later, at the end of the 19th century, a small synagogue was inaugurated at 27 am Lohteich. We also know that local Jews maintained two cemeteries: one, the older of the two, was located in a small forest between Brietz and Cheine; the other, built in 1850, was on presentday Lueneberger Strasse. In 1932/33, the leaders of the Salzwedel community, with which the Jews of Luechow were affiliated, were Hermann Bacharach, Louis Jacoby and Leon Stiefel. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA men destroyed the interior of the prayer room, wrecked the cemetery and plundered the few remaining Jewish-owned businesses, the last of which had all been “aryanized” by year’s end. The remaining Jews were eventually moved into two houses—27 Lohteich and 2 Altperverstrasse—from which they were moved, in 1941, to a barracks located on the outskirts of town. Finally, in the spring of 1942, the remaining Jews were deported to the Warsaw Ghetto. Three local Jews, all of whom were married to Christians, survived the war in Salzwedel. At least 34 Salzwedel Jews perished in the Shoah. Both Jewish cemeteries still exist, but it is only in the newer one that one can find intact headstones.

Salzkotten,1652,143 in 1863,50,"The community’s first prayer room was located in the home of Asher Cohen at 11 Vielserstrasse. Other communal institutions included the following: a synagogue, built on a small square on Vielserstrasse in 1925; and a cemetery, consecrated on Schuetzenstrasse in 1837. Local Jews established a school inside the synagogue building at some point after 1859, and we also know that the community’s leaders included Isaak Auerbach, Hermann Schramm and Julius Hecht. The synagogue was vandalized on Pogrom Night and burned down the following day. Three Jewish-owned businesses and six households were wrecked, 17 men were deported to Buchenwald, and the cemetery was damaged, after which the community was forced to sell roughly 60% of the site. On May 8, 1939, the government appropriated the former synagogue plot and converted it into a park and storage yard. In April 1939, the remaining Jews were moved into so-called “Jews’ houses” from which some were deported on December 10, 1941; two more deportations followed (the latter on July 28, 1942). At least 55 Salzkotten Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1985, the cemetery was declared a memorial. A monument, named Isaak Auerbach-Platz (after the murdered leader) was unveiled in Salzkotten on June 29, 1986.

Sandersleben,early 17th century,178 in 1807,unknown,"Although the Jews of Sandersleben were granted property rights early on, they were forbidden from engaging in handicrafts or agriculture; accordingly, most were wool and grain traders, and some later became moneylenders. The Sandersleben Jewish community, which belonged to Dessau until 1849, established a cemetery in 1730 (near Bergstrasse) and a synagogue by 1743, the latter of which later fell into disrepair, forcing the community to rent prayer halls. In 1830, however, the Jews of Sandersleben inaugurated a synagogue on the corner of Kanalstrasse and Kiethof; Duke Leopold Friedrich von Anhalt-Dessau contributed 800 Thaler to the construction of the synagogue, which seated 125 worshipers and included an elevated section for women. Although we do not know when the community’s first Jewish school closed, records do tell us that one was established in Sandersleben in the mid-18th century; Moses Philippson served as teacher from 1775 until 1814, as did Gotthold Salomon during the years 1784 to 1862. The new Jewish school, located opposite the synagogue site, was closed down in 1918. In 1932/33, the community leader was Moritz Goldstein. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue, which had been renovated in 1935, was burned down; Mr. and Mrs. Adler were arrested by the Gestapo and warned that they must leave town. At least 15 Sandersleben Jews perished in the Shoah. Rubble from the burned out synagogue was carted away during the war years, after which a new property was built on the site. The only remnant of Jewish Sandersleben is the cemetery, where one can find several intact headstones.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: FJG, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1146,1146
Sandhausen,1743,104 in 1871,18,"The modern Jewish community of Sandhausen developed in the 19th century. Jews conducted services in Leimen and Wiesloch until 1840, when the community purchased a house on Bahnhofstrasse and converted it into a prayer hall and schoolroom. After 1867, when an old church at 115 Hauptstrasse was converted into a synagogue, the prayer hall was used as living quarters for the community’s teachers. In Sandhausen, teachers also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers. The community maintained its own mikveh, but used the Wiesloch cemetery. By 1938, it had become nearly impossible to gather ten men for a minyan; accordingly, the synagogue was sold to the town council in October 1938. One month later, on Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and ransacked Jewish homes; the three remaining Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Four local Jews immigrated to the United States, five relocated within Germany, two passed away in Sandhausen and seven, the last, were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 15 Sandhausen Jews perished in the Shoah. The schoolhouse on Bahnhofstrasse was demolished in 1945.

Although a number of Jews left Sankt Goar as a result of anti-Semitic disturbances, the community continued to grow, eventually becoming the headquarters of a rabbinate. By the 19th century, however, the Jewish community of Sankt Goar had lost its erstwhile significance. The community nevertheless established, in 1844, a small prayer hall on the upper floor of a residential house; forty years later, that prayer hall was replaced by a new structure. On November 10, 1938, the synagogue was plundered, its ritual objects desecrated and its Torah scrolls burned on the street.

The teacher/chazzan instructed 20 Jewish schoolchildren (from the public elementary and secondary schools) that year, and three charity associations were active in the community: a chevra kadisha (founded in 1862), a women’s organization (founded in 1871) and the Samuel Brothers’ Foundation, the last of which aided needy students and brides. In 1934/35, Schivelbein was the seat of a district rabbinate that oversaw 20 communities. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down, Jewish men were arrested and the cemetery was desecrated, after which many Schivelbein Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany. In February 1940, the remaining Jews were deported to Lublin. At least 11 Schivelbein Jews perished in the Shoah. The former synagogue site now accommodates a park. Schivelbein’s Jewish cemetery has been desecrated on several occasions.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, HKJP, YV  www.belgard.org",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1157,1157
Schlawe,in or around the year 1718,265 in 1899,80,"Schlawe’s first Jewish resident settled there in or around 1718. By 1812, 17 Jewish families resided in the town. The community maintained a synagogue at 23 Muehlenstrasse and a cemetery at Stolper Vorstadt. In 1933, Schlawe was home to 80 Jewish residents. A teacher (he was also the community’s chazzan) instructed eight schoolchildren in religion. Two Jewish charity organizations were active in Schlawe that year: an Israelite women’s charitable society and a chevra kadisha, founded, respectively, in 1866 and 1874. An association for the study of history and literature was also active in the community, as was a social club. The synagogue was demolished on Pogrom Night, and several Jews were arrested and taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In 1937, local residents chased a Jewish groom through the town, shouting anti-Semitic slogans. Several Schlawe Jews immigrated to America, 25 immigrated to Palestine and others made their way to Berlin. The remaining Jews were deported in the summer of 1942; one local Jew, probably married to a Christian, was spared. At least 12 Schlawe Jews perished in the Shoah.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, GKJP, R, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1158,1158
Schleusingen,13th century,94 in 1861,31-33,"Although we do not know when Jews first settled in Schleusingen, records do tell us that they were persecuted there in 1298 and in 1349. The modern community, established in 1725, maintained the following communal institutions: a synagogue at 2 Wachstrasse; a cemetery at Judengrund, or “Jews’ ground” (1710-1937); and a school (established in 1725). In 1881, five years after the synagogue was destroyed in a fire, local Jews inaugurated a new house of worship. In 1933, Schleusingen was home to 31-33 Jews; a teacher from nearby Themar instructed three schoolchildren in religion. The cemetery was desecrated soon after the implementation of the anti-Jewish boycotts of 1933. On Pogrom Night, SS men vandalized the synagogue, destroyed its furniture and burned holy books and ritual objects to the accompanying cheers of bystanders. Jewish men aged 16 and 60 were arrested, taken to a local gym and, later, deported to Buchenwald. Deportations from Schleusingen were completed in 1942. At least 22 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was converted into an apartment building in 1950. A plaque (unveiled in 1988) and a stele (erected in 2008) commemorate Schleusingen’s former Jewish community.

Schluchtern,,99 in 1885,28,"In 1800, the Jewish community of Schluchtern established a prayer room in a private residence. The community’s school on Storrgasse (present-day 15 Brunnengasse) was presided over by teachers who also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers; Elias Schwarzwaelder held this post for 47 years (1860-1907). A new synagogue was constructed on the schoolhouse site in 1914, after the latter burned down. Local Jews maintained their own cemetery (laid in 1882) and mikveh (opened in 1845). In response to the worsening political situation, many Jewish-owned businesses (including a cigarette factory, a soap manufacturing company and an inn) were sold in the 1930s. On Pogrom Night, the prayer hall’s interior and ritual objects were wrecked; Jewish men were arrested and jailed for several weeks. In 1939, the prayer hall building was sold to a neighboring farmer, who used it as a barn. Several Jews moved to Schluchtern after 1933. Eight local Jews emigrated, 25 relocated within Germany, six died in Schluchtern and 12 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 18 Schluchtern Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building, which had been confiscated after the war, was sold back to the neighboring farmer in 1950. In 1966, a residential building was erected there.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL, HU, PK BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1161,1161
Schlochau,,495 in 1880,125,"In 1466, when West Prussia became part of Poland, many Jewish families moved into villages surrounding the town of Schlochau (present-day Czluchow, Poland), the only town that allowed Jews inside its walls. As a result, the Jewish community of Schlochau was the oldest in the region. Schlochau was reincorporated into West Prussia in the 18th century. In the late 1880s, at which point nearly 500 Jews lived in Schlochau, the community inaugurated a new synagogue, replacing a 16th-century structure. Anti-Jewish violence and discrimination were common in Schlochau during the early 20th century: the synagogue was desecrated, and Jewish-owned businesses were boycotted. By 1938, Schlochau was home to very few Jewish-owned businesses. The synagogue, however, was torched on Pogrom Night, and Jewish men were sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In the spring of 1940, the town’s few remaining Jews were interned in Schneidemuehl, from where they were subsequently deported. Most were murdered.","Fred Gottlieb  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1160,1160
Schluechtern,13th century,382 in 1905,unknown,"Records from the 13th century describe a cemetery in Schluechtern in which 34 Jews from the neighboring city of Fulda were buried. During the 17th century, refugees from Hungary and Spain formed a community there; records tell us that it numbered 105 members by 1776. The Jewish community flourished towards the end of the 19th century, reaching its peak, of 382 persons, in 1905. In 1898, when the old synagogue (built in 1670) was no longer able to accommodate the congregation, the community inaugurated a new synagogue; the architectural style was Byzantine, and the building accommodated 300 worshipers. Local Jews also maintained a Jewish elementary school for some 80 children, as well as a ritual bath and a cemetery. In Schluechtern—the city was home to a rabbinate—the teacher of religion served as shochet and chazzan. The congregation was Orthodox. The Jews of Schluechtern engaged in many businesses. In 1933, approximately 100 Jews left the city, most for larger cities, some for the United States. The community suffered great losses during Pogrom Night: the interior of the synagogue was wrecked, the ritual articles were destroyed and Jewish homes were looted. Thanks to the intervention of the fire department’s chief, the synagogue exterior was left intact. At least 51 Schluechtern Jews died in the Shoah. In 1949, memorial stones were unveiled at the cemetery, bearing the names of 120 murdered Jews from the Schluechtern district. Although the former synagogue building was again used as a prayer hall after the war, it was converted into a clothing factory in 1950. Later declared a protected monument, the site now serves as a cultural center; there, a memorial plaque commemorates the destroyed synagogue and its 358 congregants.","Fred Gottlieb  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1162,1162
Schmalkalden,13th century,120 in 1905,80,"Schmalkalden was home to a Jewish community during the Middle Ages. In 1622, a synagogue was built at 35 Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”); having been destroyed in a fire in 1717, it was rebuilt in 1718 and renovated in 1875 and again in 1929/30. The community maintained two cemeteries— one next to Stiller Tor (consecrated in the early 1700s), the other at Am Eichental (1895)—and a school and mikveh at 3 Naeherstiller Strasse. Eighty Jews lived in Schmalkalden in 1933. A Jewish relief fund (founded in 1926) conducted charity work, and a teacher from nearby Themar instructed seven schoolchildren in religion. Local Jews were arrested on Pogrom Night, the same night on which SA and SS men set fire to the synagogue, burned its ritual objects and vandalized Jewish homes and stores. Later, members of the SS blew up the synagogue’s ruins. Most local Jews managed to emigrate from Germany. The remaining Jews were deported during the years 1942 to 1944. At least 44 local Jews died in the Shoah. In 1988, a plaque was affixed to the apartment building that was built on the former synagogue site. The building was torn down in 2010.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJKT, EJL, FJG  www.alemannia-judaica.de/schmalkalden_friedhof.htm",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1163,1163
Schmallenberg,1685,either 58 in 1890 or 59 in 1934,between 51 and 59,"Records from 1685 mention a Jewish family living in the town. As the community was always very small, with no rabbi or mikveh, it was incorporated into the rabbinate of Lenhausen. Services were conducted in prayer rooms until 1857, when Isaak Bamberger funded the construction of a synagogue on Nordstrasse. In 1842, a cemetery was consecrated in Schmallenberg. According to a statement by the mayor, 59 Jews lived in the town in 1934. While the mayor denied the existence of any Jewish organizations in town, he did mention that some local Jews were members of the Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), unusually, local SA men refused to take part in the violence, which was carried out by SS men from Neheim. All local Jews were arrested on Pogrom Night; the women and children were released, but the men remained in custody. The synagogue was burned down on November 10. After 1939, the town’s remaining Jewish families lived in three designated “Jews’ houses.” Deportations began in March 1942. Of those who still lived in Schmallenberg in 1939, nearly all perished in the Shoah, including the few who had managed to flee to the Netherlands. Seven Jews returned to the town after the war. The land on which the synagogue once stood was sold to the municipality in November 1938. After the war, it remained in private hands with the stipulation that it would not be used for commercial purposes. In 1970, Nordstrasse was renamed Synagogenstrasse (“synagogue street”); in 1980, the municipality unveiled a plaque in memory of the synagogue; and on January 31, 1988, a bronze plaque listing the names of Schmallenberg’s murdered Jews was placed alongside the first plaque.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, EJL LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1164,1164
Schmitten,1800,unknown,,"The Jews of Schmitten conducted services in the living room of a Jewish residence until November 15, 1844, when the community celebrated the inauguration of a synagogue. The single-story, half-timbered building, built on an area of 55 square meters close to the center of the village (the street would later be called Synagogenstrasse, or “synagogue street”), contained 52 seats for men and, in the gallery, 24 seats for women. In 1890, at which point 20 Jews lived in the Schmitten, the regional council attempted to dissolve the Jewish community and merge it with nearby Anspach. The Jews of Schmitten, however, aided by the election of Sina Hess as leader of religious services, managed to keep their status as an independent community. Years later, in 1920, the community was affiliated with Unsingen. From 1883 onwards, many non-local Jews, attracted by the spas in Schmitten, spent their summers there, attending the synagogue and enriching the service. Schmitten’s kosher health resort (named Strauss), established in or around 1910, had a prayer room. Prominent local Jews included: Josef Herz, who fell in World War I; Moritz Hess, a cattle dealer and the last head of the community; and Hermann Strauss, a hotelkeeper and an honorary prayer leader. Four Jewish families—Strauss, Hess, Herz and Loewenstein—remained in Schmitten after 1933; by 1937, only the four members of the Loewenstein family still lived there. Some community members moved to other towns; others immigrated to the United States, South Africa and South America. At least five Schmitten Jews perished in the Shoah. On November 9, 1938, rioters damaged the defunct synagogue. The village authorities purchased the building after Pogrom Night and, later, sold it to a private buyer. In 1995, the building, which had served its owner as a garage and storehouse, was pulled down, soon after which, on July 15, 1996, a memorial was unveiled in Schmitten. At the cemetery—consecrated on a hill outside Schmitten in 1820—nine tombs and one tombstone are still intact (the tombstone was transferred there from neighboring Arnoldshain).","Wolfgang Breese  Sources: AJ, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1166,1166
Schmieheim,1624,580 in 1864,120,"Schmieheim’s regional Jewish cemetery, consecrated in 1682, became the largest in South Baden.

By 1855, 120 students attended Schmieheim’s Jewish school (opened in the 1830s and closed in 1876). In 1933, a teacher from Kuppenheim instructed the town’s Jewish schoolchildren. A Jewish women’s association was active in Schmieheim that year. On Pogrom Night, Jewish homes were vandalized, a Jew was assaulted and the synagogue’s interior was demolished. The mayor not only prevented the synagogue building being burned down, but arranged for the protection of Jewish businesses. Twenty-eight men, however, were sent to Dachau. Thirty-two local Jews emigrated, 61 relocated in Germany, 17 died in the town and 14 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. Eight elderly Jews remained after the deportations: one died in the town, and the others were deported to the East from different locations in 1941/1942. At least 45 Schmieheim Jews died in the Shoah. In 2001, a geniza (storeroom for holy books) was found in the residential building now standing on the former synagogue site.

A regional Jewish cemetery opened in Schnaittach in 1537, and a yeshiva was active there during the 17th century. Schnaittach became part of Bavaria in 1806, after which the town’s rabbinate served the Jewish communities of the whole region until 1883. Two more cemeteries were consecrated in Schnaittach; one in 1834, the other in 1897. The community also maintained a Jewish school and a mikveh. In 1933, a teacher/chazzan instructed the Jewish children of Schnaittach and of the neighboring communities. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s contents were burned. The building itself, a designated museum, was spared, as were the Torah scrolls and ritual objects intended for exhibition there. Jews were arrested, Jewish homes were attacked, the teacher was seriously injured and several Jews were sent to Nuremberg prison, where one woman committed suicide. The synagogue museum opened in 1939. Fourteen Schnaittach Jews emigrated, 20 relocated within Germany and six died in Schnaittach. By the end of 1938, no Jews lived in Schnaittach.

Schneidemuehl,16th century (see below),"1,039 in 1858",approximately 600,"By the end of the 16th century, Schneidemuehl was home to a functioning Jewish community. Members of the early community lived in a designated Jewish quarter, surrounded by a moat, on the outskirts of town. In 1655, 33 local Jews were killed by a band of Swedish soldiers, who also destroyed the synagogue and its ritual objects. Although local Jews received a letter of royal protection in 1670, it was not until the 19th century that the community began to flourish. Established in the 1830s, Schneidemuehl’s Jewish elementary school was destroyed, as was the synagogue, in the fire of 1834. In 1841, a new synagogue was built on Wilhelmsplatz; it was in the 1840s, too, that the community established a new school and a mikveh. By the end of the 1850s, over 1,000 Jews lived in Schneidemuehl. We also know that from the late 1920s onwards, Schneidemuehl was home to a district rabbinate of which approximately 1,400 Jews from 14 communities were members. In 1932/33, the leaders of the community were Isidor Lewin, Alex Soldin and Nathan Moses. Dr. Arthur Rosenzweig was rabbi, and Siegfried Sommerfeld and Samuel Rosenthal headed a representative committee of 13 members. In charge of the cemetery, synagogue and community finances were J. Lewin, S. Jacob (the chazzan) and a lawyer named Fleisher. The community was also home to a local center for Jewish welfare, which, under the leadership of Dr. Adolf Bieber, distributed food and fuel to the needy. Other local Jewish associations included the following: a chevra kadisha (88 members) led by Max Simonsohn; a sisterhood (131 members) led by Erna Frankel; an association for interest-free loans (53 members) led by Dr. Bieber; a Jewish youth group led by a man named Werner; a German-Jewish youth group led by Ludwig Rosenthal; the Salo-Adler lodge; and, finally, a sisterhood associated with the Salo-Adler lodge. In 1932/33, 62 Jewish children attended Schneidemuehl’s various schools. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire; 63 Jewish businesses and 23 Jewish homes were also ravaged. By May 1939, only 116 Jews lived in Schneidemuehl. The old cemetery was destroyed in 1939, after which the site was converted into a public park. Gravestones were used to shore up the river banks; although two of the three surviving stones were restored in the 1990s, they were later destroyed by vandals. Those Jews who failed to emigrate were interned in the Buergergarten in March 1940, from where they were deported to the East on March 21, 1940.

Two chevra kadisha organizations (one for men, the other for women) were active that year. In November 1934, windows in the synagogue and Jewish houses were broken, after which the community boarded up the synagogue’s windows and transferred the Torah scrolls to private homes. The High Holiday services of October 1935 were held under police protection. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was blown up after rioters destroyed its interior, its furniture and ritual objects. Jewish homes were ransacked and looted, and four Jews were deported: two to Dachau, and two to Buchenwald (where one died). Six Jews immigrated to the United States.

In or around the year 1725, around which time a synagogue was built in Schoetmar, the Jewish community came into being. The community later merged with that in the nearby town of Uflen to become the joint rabbinate of Uflen-Schoetmar (later, Bad-Salzuflen-Schoetmar). Local Jews conducted services in prayer rooms until 1725, when a synagogue was built at 23 Bergsstrasse. In 1800, another synagogue was built in the Schoetmar manor (called Rittergut), but it was sold and demolished in 1888, when construction work on a new synagogue (on Echternstrasse) began. Inaugurated on August 1 of that same year, the new house of worship’s distinctive features were its arch and Moorish elements. The Jewish cemetery was consecrated either in 1871 or in 1877. In 1933, the community numbered 53 members; according to records, a Jewish school was still active that year. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), local SA men ransacked and set fire to the synagogue. The interior burned down completely, but the roof and walls withstood the flames. Jewish homes and businesses were also destroyed on Pogrom Night, and nine Jews were arrested and taken to Buchenwald. The synagogue building was sold to a contractor in 1939. Of the 38 Jews still living in Schoetmar in May 1939, 20 were deported between December 1941 and July 1942. The remaining 18 Jews managed to escape.

In 1856, three years after the synagogue burned down in a fire, the community inaugurated a new house of worship. By the 1920s, however, the Jewish population had dwindled to such an extent that it had become difficult to gather a minyan. Accordingly, a teacher from Schweinfurt was hired to instruct Schonungen’s remaining Jewish children On Pogrom Night, the synagogue interior was destroyed, as were its contents. Several Jewish homes were destroyed, and the remaining Jews were abused. Eight Schonungen Jews emigrated and six relocated within Germany. In April 1942, six were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg); one Jewish woman was sent to Wuerzburg in May of that year (her fate is unknown). Schonungen’s last Jews, an elderly couple, were deported to Theresienstadt, also via Wuerzburg, in September 1942. At least eight Schonungen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Built in the Moorish architectural style, the Schoenbeck synagogue resembled the Oranienburger Strasse synagogue in Berlin. On Pogrom Night, the cemetery was damaged, Jewishowned homes and businesses were looted, 10 men were sent to concentration camps and the synagogue interior was destroyed.

Schotten Jews opened an elementary school in 1820 and a new synagogue (at 54 Hauptstrasse, or present-day 156 Vogelsbergstrasse) in 1863; next to the synagogue, in an adjacent building, were the mikveh, school and teacher’s apartment. The cemetery was enlarged in 1886, and we also know that the synagogue underwent renovations, during which the walls were adorned with paintings, in 1929. Schotten’s Jewish elementary school was dissolved in 1894, but children were able to continue studying religion with the teacher. In 1933, 76 Jews lived in Schotten; nine schoolchildren received religious instruction. Jewish women’s and men’s associations, two charitable organizations and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active in the community, to which the three Jews of Rainrod had been affiliated.

Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters vandalized and looted Jewish homes, destroyed the interiors of the synagogue and school and stole valuable ritual objects. Eighteen Schotten Jews emigrated, 32 relocated within Germany, one died in a psychiatric institution (apparently murdered in the Nazis’ euthanasia program) and six passed away in Schotten. In September 1942, six local Jews were deported to Theresienstadt and six to Auschwitz. At least 48 Schotten Jews lost their lives in the Shoah. Acquired by a new owner after 1945, the synagogue was eventually converted into a residential and storage building.

Schwaebisch-Gmuend,1241,97 in 1890,90,"The medieval Jewish quarter of Schwaebisch-Gmuend, established in 1258, accommodated a synagogue, a mikveh, a school and, perhaps, a cemetery. Jews were persecuted in the town in 1298, annihilated in the Black Death pogroms of 1349 and expelled from Schwaebisch-Gmuend in 1469, in 1501 and again in 1521. The modern Jewish community of Schwaebisch-Gmuend was established in 1890. Local Jews maintained prayer rooms until 1926, when a synagogue and school were established at 4 Katharinenstrasse. Burials were conducted in Oberdorf and, later, in Stuttgart. We also know that Schwaebisch-Gmuend was home to two ancient ritual baths. In 1933, the teacher/chazzan instructed ten schoolchildren in religion. Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in Schwaebisch-Gmuend that year. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; local Jews were sent to Dachau. The community was disbanded shortly afterwards, and the synagogue was sold to a bank in 1939. The remaining Jews were then crammed into several houses from which they were taken for forced labor. Thirty-eight local Jews emigrated, 47 relocated within Germany, three died in Schwaebisch-Gmuend, one committed suicide and approximately 20 were deported to the East. At least 18 Schwaebisch-Gmuend Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was demolished in the early 1950s.

Schriesheim,14th century,132 in 1864,38,"The medieval Jewish community of Schriesheim was annihilated in the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. It was not until the 17th century that a new Jewish community emerged there. Local Jews congregated in a private prayer room, established in 1807, until 1843, when the community converted a former church into a synagogue. Schriesheim was also home to a Jewish community center—it housed a mikveh, a school and a teacher’s apartment—but the date of its construction is not known. Records do tell us, however, that the center was sold in 1897, after which the school was moved to the local pastor’s former house, near the synagogue. The community consecrated a cemetery on In der Ploeck in 1874. In 1933, a teacher from Leutershausen instructed three Jewish schoolchildren in religion. A chevra kadisha was active in Leutershausen that year. Later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; books, rugs and furniture were burned outside the village. Twenty-six local Jews emigrated, nine relocated within Germany and two died in Schriesheim. The town’s remaining Jews left Schriesheim in September 1939. At least 21 Schriesheim Jews perished in the Shoah. Today, the residential building standing on the former synagogue site bears a plaque (unveiled in 1988).

The community used the Steinbach cemetery, but maintained its own mikveh. Steinbach Jews were affiliated with Schwaebisch-Hall in 1894. Dr. Jakob Berlinger was the district rabbi in 1933. Two charitable associations, a women’s association and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, Jewish property was vandalized, the prayer hall was demolished, furniture and ritual objects were burned in the marketplace and the Steinbach synagogue was burned down. Jews were assaulted, and two were sent to Dachau.

At least 20 Schwaebisch-Hall Jews perished in the Shoah. During the Nazi period, 800 inmates were detained in a labor camp (a branch of Dachau) at the local airfield; later, a mass grave was discovered there.

Schwanenberg,in or around the year 1600,40 in 1812,unknown,"Jews first settled in Schwanenberg at the beginning of the 17th century. In 1812, eight Jewish families (40 Jews) lived in the town. The Schwanenberg Jewish community was incorporated into the rabbinate of Geilenkirchen-Heinsberg- Erkelenz in 1861. On November 27, 1868, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Lindches Weg. A Jewish cemetery was located in the district of Lentholt, but its funding source and history are not known; according to records, there was a mikveh in the same area. Many Jews left Schwanenberg for larger urban areas in the 19th century; accordingly, few Jews still lived there in 1933. The synagogue had been all but abandoned by then, and when vandals broke its windows in 1936, a service had not been conducted there for over a year. On Pogrom Night, SA and SS men burned the synagogue to the ground. Jewish residents from the surrounding areas tried to rescue what remained of the interior, but were prevented from doing so by the SS and SA. No funerals took place at the cemetery after 1938. Schwanenberg’s remaining Jews were either arrested or deported to the Hetzerath ghetto (in Erkelenz), where, from 1941/42 onwards, all the Jews of the region were crammed into a house known as the Hetzerather Hof/Spiesshof. On March 24, 1942, these Jews were deported to the Belzec death camp in Poland. The synagogue building no longer exists, but there is a memorial plaque on the site.

Schwanfeld,unknown,230 in 1816 (37.2% of the total population),58,"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Schwanfeld mentions the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298. A Jewish community was re-established in the village in the 16th century. The Jews of Schwanfeld consecrated a cemetery in 1579, the same year during which they were permitted to appoint a rabbi, establish a Beit Din (a rabbinical court) and open a prayer hall. It was not until 1786, however, that a synagogue was built in Schwanfeld. We also know that a Jewish public school existed there in 1850, and that the village was home to a private Jewish elementary school in 1924. In 1933, the community employed a teacher—he also served as served as chazzan and shochet—who instructed five schoolchildren in religion. Five Jewish associations were active in Schwanfeld that year. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects. Twenty-eight Schwanfeld Jews emigrated (25 went to the United States) and ten relocated within Germany. Eight of the remaining ten Jews were deported to Izbica (via Wuerzburg) in April 1942; the last two were deported to Theresienstadt (also via Wuerzburg) in September of the same year. At least 37 Schwanfeld Jews perished in the Shoah.

Schwedt,1670,206 in 1890,205,"Benedikt Levi, a protected Jew (Schutzjude), is credited with founding this community in 1671, around which time local Jews consecrated a cemetery. During the 18th century, the Jewish population of Schwedt grew steadily. The community built a synagogue on the Judenstrasse, or “Jews’ street” (later renamed Mittelstrasse) which was replaced, in 1862, by a new synagogue which housed an elementary school and a mikveh. Schwedt’s first rabbi was hired in 1841, and we also know that the Orthodox members of the community formed their own congregation in a rented hall when Rabbi Natan Hirsch Kuttner introduced a series of reform-oriented changes. Most Schwedt Jews were horse dealers during the community’s early years, but later, as Schwedt grew into a manufacturing hub for tobacco products, local Jews played a prominent part in the development of that industry. As was the case in the rest of Germany, anti-Semitism flourished in Schwedt after the 1933 elections: the boycott was applied zealously, and Jewish business owners were forced to display anti-Jewish placards on their storefronts. The synagogue was set on fire on Pogrom Night, but the fire was quickly extinguished out of concern for a nearby petrol station; the interior, however, was wrecked. Jewish homes were broken into that night and householders were arrested. By May 1939, only 27 Jews still lived in Schwedt, six of whom were deported in 1942; the others had moved to Berlin or Stettin, from where they, too, were presumably deported. In 1988, memorial plaques were unveiled at the former synagogue and cemetery.

Schwarza,1411,287 in 1846,,"The modern Jewish community of Schwarza was founded in the 17th century. In 1680, the community built a synagogue on Huettenstrasse (present-day Irma Stern Strasse), prior to which Jews presumably conducted services in a prayer hall. Although the synagogue was renovated in 1754, the growing congregation inaugurated a larger house of worship in 1841. The community also maintained a school, a mikveh and a cemetery, the last of which was consecrated on Lindenrain and was in use either from 1693 until 1936, or from 1791 until 1936 (sources provide differing information). As a result of dwindling membership numbers, the community was dissolved in 1930, after which, in 1932, the remaining Jews were affiliated with the community in Suhl. Although the synagogue had been sold in 1935, the SA nevertheless broke into the building on Pogrom Night, ransacking its interior and burning Torah scrolls, ritual objects and furniture. The town’s few remaining Jews were deported in 1942. At least nine Schwarza Jews were murdered in the Shoah, among them Irma Stern. In honor of Stern and the former Jewish community, the street on which the community’s first synagogue had been located was later named Irma Stern Strasse. What remained of the synagogue building attacked on Pogrom Night was torn down in 1978 (or possibly 1981/82).

Schweich,1639,144 in 1863,91,"The Schweich synagogue, first mentioned in 1820 and located on the corner of Richtstrasse and Bahnhofstrasse, replaced an 18th-century prayer room; the congregation (for whom there were 25-30 seats) conducted services on the upper floor, as the lower floor housed a schoolroom. In 1852, the community inaugurated a new synagogue on Richtstrasse (renovated in 1886), but records do not tell us much about its architectural style or seating capacity. Schweich’s Jewish cemetery, consecrated in 1776, was located on Kurfuerstliche Acht. In 1933, 91 Jews lived in Schweich. Fifteen pupils attended the Jewish elementary school, and a chevra kadisha, a women’s association and a youth group were active in the community. Most Jews left Schweich during the next few years, so that by 1939 only 14 Jews remained in the town. On Pogrom Night, axe-wielding rioters desecrated the cemetery and destroyed the synagogue’s windows, interior and ritual objects. Sold to a farmer in 1940, the synagogue later housed prisoners of war. In October 1941, the town’s remaining five Jews were deported to the East. At least 65 Schweich Jews perished in the Shoah.

Schweidnitz,1250,,114,"Jews lived in Schweidnitz (present-day Swidnica, Poland) from the time the town was founded in the mid-13th century. In 1380, the Schweidnitz Jewish community built a school, established a synagogue and consecrated a cemetery. Many famous scholars attended the town’s yeshiva for higher learning. In 1453, Johann von Capistrano, a Franciscan monk, accused the Jews of host desecration and had several Jews burned at the stake while the rest were banished. The city authorities proclaimed that Jews would never again live in Schweidnitz. It was not until the early 1800s that the ban was rescinded. A new Jewish community was formed in Schweidnitz in 1847, not long after which its members established a prayer room. Plans for the construction of a new synagogue, which was to be funded by membership dues and the proceeds of a raffle, were drawn up in 1870 and, in 1877, a new synagogue with a seating capacity of 250 was inaugurated on the Sedanplatz. Anti-Semitic violence intensified after World War I. In 1933, as a result of the boycott of Jewish businesses, many Jews left town. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), SS and SA troops burned down the synagogue, desecrated the cemetery and destroyed Jewishowned businesses; many local Jews were arrested. Little is known about the fate of Schweidnitz’s remaining Jews. After the war, Schweidnitz/Swidnica served as a transit point for Jews wishing to leave Germany. With a Jewish population of 2,400, a new community was established there in 1949; by 1970, however, that number had dropped to approximately one hundred Jews.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1184,1184
Schweinfurt,1212,490 in 1880,,"By the 15th century, Schweinfurt’s medieval Jewish community had established a mikveh and a cemetery. Jews were persecuted in Schweinfurt throughout the Middle Ages. In 1863, by which point the town was home to a prayer hall, the Jews of Schweinfurt founded a community. One year later, a district rabbinate was established in the town. In 1874, the community inaugurated a synagogue (at 14 Siebenbrueckleingasse) and a Jewish section in the municipal cemetery. (This section was purchased by the Jewish community in 1908.) A community center was built near the synagogue in 1888, and the synagogue was renovated in 1928. In 1933, Dr. Salomon Stein was district rabbi. The community’s teacher/ chazzan instructed 31 children that year, and several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide Jewish organizations were active in the community. Rabbi Stein was replaced by Dr. Max Koehler in 1934. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were some of its ritual objects. Torah scrolls were trampled on, and the community’s offices, classrooms and mikveh were wrecked. Jews, including the elderly and the sick, were marched through town, verbally abused, and pelted with stones. Approximately 30 Jews, including Rabbi Koehler, were deported to Dachau. Jewish homes and businesses were severely damaged that night. During the Nazi period, 225 Schweinfurt Jews emigrated, 221 relocated within Germany and 39 died in Schweinfurt. Thirty were deported to Izbica in April 1942; and twenty-six were deported to Theresienstadt in September of that year. At least 102 Schweinfurt Jews perished in the Shoah.

Schweinsberg,1332,52 in 1871,27,"The Jewish community of Schweinsberg (present-day Stadtallendorf ) developed in the 17th century. The community established all the essential institutions: a synagogue, a mikveh, a school for religious studies and a cemetery. In Schweinsberg, the Jewish schoolteacher often performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Local Jews conducted services in prayer rooms—one was established in the home of Nehm Schmuhl and, apparently, another in the home of a man named Moses—until 1820, when a synagogue was inaugurated not far from Moses’ home. The synagogue served the community until it burned down in the fire of October 1872; its five Torah scrolls were saved, however, and used in the new synagogue on Biegenstrasse, which was built in 1873/74. Burials were conducted in Rauischholzhausen until the mid-18th century, when a cemetery was consecrated in Schweinsberg. Only 21 Jews lived in Schweinsberg in 1938, but the synagogue was nevertheless burned to the ground on Pogrom Night, after which cattle stables were erected there. In late July 1942, Schweinsberg’s last six Jews were sent to Rauischholzhausen, from where they were deported to Theresienstadt on September 6, 1942. At least 35 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

Schwelm,,,,"Schwelm’s first two documented Jewish residents are mentioned in a local registration list dated 1593/95. The community never had an official rabbi, and in 1854 became a sub-community of Hagen. Local Jews conducted services in prayer rooms until a synagogue was built at 15 Fronhofstrasse; it was inaugurated on August 6, 1819, the same year in which a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Schwelm. The community also maintained an elementary school—located in the synagogue building and, later, in a private residence on Neumarkt—but the school was closed in 1892 as a result of low enrollment numbers. In 1933, 54 Jews lived in Schwelm, with 34 remaining by year’s end, a result of Schwelm’s early embrace of anti- Jewish violence: SA men blocked the entrance to Jewish stores to enforce the boycott, and the town’s walls were often smeared with anti-Jewish graffiti. The community sold the synagogue building on November 14, 1937, after which the Torah scrolls were transferred to Gevelsberg. The Nazis had planned to incinerate the synagogue building on Pogrom Night, but were prevented from doing so by local authorities. Instead, they broke into the building and destroyed its interior; the building was torn down shortly afterwards. At the cemetery, gravestones were vandalized and knocked down. Several Jewish homes were also vandalized, as was the only remaining Jewish-owned store (owned by Ludwig Heinemann). In 1938, 25 Jews lived in Schwelm. When the deportations began in 1942, the seven remaining Jews were forced into a “Jews’ house” on Bahnhofsstrasse. All seven were deported to and perished in the camps. Three Jews of mixed descent were deported for slave labor and returned to Schwelm after the war.

Schwerin,1266,391 in 1875,151,"A small number of Jews were permitted to live in Schwerin in 1267. After centuries of pogroms, burnings at the stake and expulsions, Jews were permitted to return to Schwerin in 1679, albeit with restrictions: in addition to being forced to pay exorbitant taxes and protection money, they were limited to certain business activities. As a result, the Jewish population of that period never exceeded thirty. When these cumbersome restrictions were relaxed in the mid-1700s, more Jews moved to Schwerin. Although the community received permission to build a synagogue in 1773, it was not able to gather the necessary funds until 1819. Shortly after the inauguration of the synagogue, the anti-Jewish Hep-Hep riots erupted: angry crowds marched in front of the synagogue chanting “Kick out the Jews,” but Schwerin Jews, unlike their contemporaries in other towns and cities, were spared the brunt of the pogrom. Beginning in 1933, when the Nazis instituted the anti- Jewish boycott, Jews started to leave Schwerin in large numbers. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the interior of the synagogue was ransacked, after which the contents were burned in one of the city’s squares. Forbidden to set the synagogue on fire because of its proximity to many homes, the Nazis forced the Jews to tear down the building themselves. By 1942, Schwerin’s remaining Jews had all been deported. Three years after the war, a group of Jews returned to Schwerin and founded a new Jewish community. By 1947, 100 Jews lived there. After buying two homes on the street on which the old synagogue once stood, the community converted one into a synagogue and the other into a community center. The Jewish population dwindled during the ensuing decades (three members in 1980), but an influx of Jewish arrivals from the former Soviet Union rejuvenated the defunct community. In 2005, 1,000 Jews lived in Schwerin (more than double the peak pre-war population). In 1951, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site, and in 1984, planning commenced for a building that would house a miniature replica of the destroyed synagogue.

Although the community grew during the 18th and 19th centuries, it did not employ a rabbi or operate any Jewish organizations. Between 1900 and 1932, seven Jews served on the city council. The community conducted services in a prayer room (at 7 Hellpothstrasse) in 1750. From the year 1805, when the municipality authorized the construction of a synagogue, and 1854, when the house of worship was finally inaugurated, Jews used a prayer room in the Wortmann home on Kirchhof. On September 1, 1854, a synagogue on Grosse Marktstrasse was inaugurated and, in 1898, a Jewish school was built at Nordwall (the school closed in the 1920s). Local Jews buried their dead in the cemetery at Nordwall from the mid-18th century onwards. By June 1933, only 60 Jews remained in Schwerte. The policy of “aryanization” ensured that there were no Jewish-owned businesses in Schwerte by 1938. On Pogrom Night, Nazis ransacked the synagogue and then burned its interior; Jewish apartments were vandalized by the mob that night; the Red Cross later appropriated the synagogue building. The 19 Jews who still lived in Schwerte in 1939 were forcibly moved into the barracks on Liethstrasse. Fourteen local Jews were deported to the camps in 1942/43.

In 1898, in response to growing population numbers, the community moved its prayer facilities to the local castle at Zeyherstrasse. The castle was used as a field hospital during World War I; therefore, from 1914 to 1917, prayers were conducted at a restaurant and in a factory. The community employed teachers of religion who also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers. We also know that, in 1893, a Jewish cemetery was opened in Schwetzingen. Fourteen Jewish children studied religion in Schwetzingen in 1933. Several Jewish associations and branches of nationwide organizations were active in the town. The prayer hall was seized by the Nazis in March 1933, after which prayers were conducted in private residences. Later, on Pogrom Night, November 1938, the prayer room was demolished, homes were attacked, the teacher was beaten and men were sent to Dachau. Thirty-four local Jews emigrated, 53 relocated within Germany, four died in Schwetzingen and five were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 23 Schwetzingen Jews perished in the Shoah.

Sehnde,1820s,19 in 1885,11,"This tiny community of Jewish traders, butchers and merchants was affiliated with the community in neighboring Bolzum in 1843. Sehnde Jews attended the Bolzum synagogue on Marktstrasse, which was destroyed by fire in 1857 and rebuilt in 1859; the building housed a school and an apartment for a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan. It was in Bolzum, too, that the Jews of Sehnde buried their dead. In 1900, in response to Bolzum’s dwindling Jewish population, the center of the community was moved to Sehnde, after which the Bolzum synagogue was sold, and its inventory transferred to the Rose family’s home and business on Mittelstrasse in Sehnde, where a rented prayer room was established. On Pogrom Night, rioters smashed windows in the prayer room building. Jewish businesses were vandalized and looted, a Jewish woman was assaulted, and one Jew was arrested and deported to the concentration camp in Sachsenhausen. In 1941, Jews from Sehnde were deported to the Riga ghetto; in 1942, others were deported to Theresienstadt. Approximately 10 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The Bolzum cemetery was desecrated before the end of the war and vandalized in 1973.

Jewish children were instructed by teachers, who also served as ritual slaughterers and cantors; Nathaniel Wolf held this position for 31 years (1876-1907). Burials were conducted in Boedigheim until 1882, when the community established its own cemetery. In 1933, seven Jewish schoolchildren studied religion in Sennfeld. A charity association, a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith and a Zionist pioneer farm (1936-1939) were active in Sennfeld. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night. Ritual objects were set on fire, and Jewish property was attacked. Jews, including trainees at the Zionist farm, were assaulted.

Siegburg,1287,370 in 1905,302,"Siegburg must have been home to a significant medieval Jewish community, as records from that period mention a synagogue, a mikveh and a cemetery. The modern Jewish community, whose roots can be traced to the 17th century, was one of the region’s most prominent during the early 19th century. Some Siegburg Jews were interned in a forced labor camp in Cologne, and others were moved into designated “Jews’ houses” before being deported to a camp in Munich and, later, to the East. Approximately 100 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1988, a memorial fountain built in the shape of a Star of David was erected in Siegburg. The cemetery contains a memorial plaque. The community’s first prayer room was located in Moshe Levi’s home on Holzgasse, which the community inherited after the owner’s death in 1782. In 1841, a small synagogue—the simple building featured a women’s balcony and large glass windows—was built at 26 Holzgasse, behind the community center and teacher’s residence; a mikveh was installed there in 1872, and we also know that the building accommodated a school. After the year 1900, when the building was placed under lease, the community used only its upper floor. Local Jews maintained a youth movement, a Talmud Torah school and a Chevro Ezrath Dllalim (a charitable association). Jews were represented on the municipal council and, in 1890, a local Jew was appointed chairman of the DDP (the German Democratic Party). In 1934, the Agudat Israel association set up an agricultural training program for potential immigrants to Palestine. Established in an old factory and presided over by teacher Selig Wolf, the program graduated approximately 200 youngsters from all over Germany, among them the founders of Kibbutz Hafetz Hayim in Israel; the training camp down closed in 1937. On Pogrom Night, members of the SS and SA burned down the synagogue; the community center and school were destroyed, as were six of the remaining 13 Jewish-owned stores.

The Jews of Setterich conducted services in prayer rooms until the start of the 19th century, when a synagogue was established at 9 Bahnhofstrasse. According to the current mayor of nearby Baesweiler, 43 Jews lived in Baesweiler, Setterich and Oidtweiler in 1933. On Pogrom Night, ritual artifacts were stolen from the Setterich synagogue; it is not known, however, whether an attempt was made to burn down the building, which was demolished in 1939.

Siegen,13th century,130 in 1925,122,"Jews first lived in Siegen in the 13th century, but government restrictions prevented large numbers from settling there until the latter half of the 19th century. Siegen’s Jewish school, opened in 1871, was recognized as a public Jewish elementary school in 1886, just two years after local Jews established an official community (in 1884). Services were conducted in prayer rooms located in various family homes—records mention two such rooms on Lindenstrasse and Poststrasse—until July 22, 1904, when the community inaugurated a synagogue on Am Obergraben (the school was moved to the same building). The Jewish cemetery on Lindenberg was consecrated in 1871. From the early 20th century onwards, local Jews, many of whom were livestock traders, butchers and shop owners, were active in the town’s social and political life. A Jewish women’s association and a women’s union conducted charity work in Siegen. The anti-Jewish boycott was enforced in Siegen several months after it was officially announced. In all, 24 Jewish-owned businesses were expropriated during the “aryanization” process. On Pogrom Night, all Siegen’s Jewish men were arrested and sent to the Oranienburg concentration camp, where they were interned for many weeks. On November 10, 1938 (one day after Pogrom Night), rioters burned the synagogue’s furniture and stole the Torah scrolls. By 1939, what remained of the building had been removed, after which an air raid shelter was built on the site. Thirty-nine Siegen Jews were deported to the camps; six local Jewish women who were married to Christians survived the war. A memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site in the 1960s.

The synagogue was demolished in 1911, after which a new house of worship was built on the same site. Local Jews established a Jewish school in 1824 and a cemetery at some point before 1880, the latter of which was enlarged in 1898. Eighty-one Jews lived in Simmern in 1933. By the late 1930s, that number had dwindled to 20. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was burned to the ground. Twelve (at least) Simmern Jews immigrated to Palestine; another twelve to the United States; eleven were deported to the East in April 1940; and two, Simmern’s last, were deported in June 1940. At least 32 former Jewish residents of Simmern perished in the Shoah. The synagogue’s ruins were demolished in 1950.

The dead were buried in Waibstadt until a cemetery was opened at Krebsgrundweg in or around the year 1890. In 1933, 17 Jewish schoolchildren studied religion in Sinsheim. Five Jewish associations were active in the town. In 1936, a local Jew was sent to a concentration camp for alleged “race defilement.” Later, on Pogrom Night, SA men demolished the synagogue building and its roof. Furniture and ritual objects were burned in the town square, and two Jews were beaten and sent to Dachau. Twenty-three local Jews emigrated, 39 relocated within Germany, three died in Sinsheim and four were murdered in the Nazis’ “euthanasia” program.

Local Jews never established an official school but, rather, employed a teacher who gave religious instruction three times a week. Jews and Christians coexisted peacefully in Singhofen until 1933, when the Nazis implemented their anti-Jewish boycott. By 1938, nearly all Jews had left the town.

The Jews of Solingen grew in number during the 19th century; and in 1853, together with the smaller Jewish congregations in the area, they founded an official synagogue community. According to records, the Jewish cemetery on Estherweg was consecrated in the 1720s (and enlarged in 1900). In 787, local Jews purchased a house at 25 Suedwall (present- day Ufergarten) and converted it into a synagogue and mikveh. Later, in 1858, the growing community decided to establish a larger synagogue. A suitable site was found on Malteserstrasse in 1861, but financial difficulties delayed construction, so that the new synagogue—it seated 150 men and 80 women—was not inaugurated until March 8, 1872; the site also accommodated a mikveh, a school building and an apartment for a teacher. Local Jews were involved in the textile, leather and fur businesses; others were butchers. Four factories that manufactured steel blades were Jewish-owned, two of which were considered large. In Solingen, Jewish organizations helped with burials and looked after the indigent, the sick and the elderly. In response to the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933, many Solingen Jews immigrated to Palestine. On November 9, 1938, SA men vandalized the synagogue and set it on fire, after which (the following day), the dome was blown up; the site was cleared in January 1939, an expense for which the Jewish congregation was billed. Private residences, Jewish- owned shops and the cemetery were vandalized on Pogrom Night, and 32 Jewish men were arrested. In 1941/42, the remaining Jews—most Jews had left Solingen by 1939—were deported to Lodz, Dachau and to Theresienstadt. At least 40 Solingen Jews perished in the Shoah. Few Jews returned to the town after the war; approximately ten lived there in the late 1960s. At the synagogue site, where a shelter was built in 1943/44, a plaque commemorates the former house of worship (the plaque was unveiled in 1979). The cemetery contains a memorial, and another plaque was unveiled on Malteserstrasse in 1998.","Swetlana Frank  Sources: FJG, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1210,1210
Somborn,unknown,,,"The Jews of Somborn belonged to the community of Meerholz until 1905. Religious services were initially conducted in prayer rooms, but in 1906 the newly-founded Somborn community established a synagogue (40 seats for men, 27 for women) at 14 Josephstrasse. Although the community was able to maintain a religious school and a mikveh, burials took place in Niedermittlau. Jewish children attended the elementary school in Meerholz. Somborn belonged to the Hanau district rabbinate. In 1931/32, the community leaders were Josef Sonneberg and Siegfried Strauss. Leo Strauss instructed six children in religion that year. Forty-seven Jews lived in Somborn in 1933, shortly after which seven emigrated from or relocated within Germany. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the interior of the synagogue was destroyed; during the Shoah, the building housed prisoners of war. Only four Jews lived in Somborn in 1939; in 1942, the last two were deported. At least 19 Somborn Jews perished in the Shoah. During the years 1945 to 1955, the former synagogue building was used as a school. It stood empty until 1966, when it was converted into a residential building. In November 2002, a plaque commemorating the destroyed community was affixed to the house of Josef Sonneberg, a former Jewish resident.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, FJG, SIH",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1211,1211

A new synagogue was built in 1745, but in 1819 the community decided to replace the older structure with another synagogue at 100 Hetchegasse (later 2 Casparigasse). The new house of worship contained a classroom and an apartment for a teacher, who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. The Sommerhausen mikveh, which the authorities closed down for sanitary reasons for the first time in 1832 (it reopened) and again in 1843, was eventually refurbished.

The community dwindled steadily during the early 20th century, and in 1928 the synagogue ceased to offer regular services. In June 1938, when only six Jews lived in the village, the community was dissolved. Although the synagogue had been converted into a grain store, its windows were nevertheless broken on Pogrom Night. Sommerhausen’s remaining Jewish homes were ransacked. Ten Sommerhausen Jews emigrated, nine relocated within Germany and three died in Sommerhausen (one committed suicide). The village’s last two Jews, both women, moved to Wuerzburg in February 1941. At least 36 Sommerhausen Jews perished in the Shoah. After 1941, the former synagogue was used as a warehouse and as living quarters for working women.

During the Nazi period many elderly Jews were sent to the Wilhelmsruhe retirement home. Most of the synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night, November 1938, and the Wilhelmsruhe home was severely damaged; its physician beaten. The cemetery’s purification hall was also destroyed. One hundred and sixty residents from the retirement home were sent to other institutions after the home was shut down in 1940; 36 of those remaining were murdered in “euthanasia” killings and in the camps.

Speyer,11th century,535 in 1890,269,"Speyer’s medieval Jewish community maintained a synagogue, a cemetery (both were consecrated in the 11th century) and a mikveh, the last of which was built before 1128. Another synagogue was inaugurated in Altspeyer (Old Speyer) in 1104, and in 1150 the rabbinates of Speyer, Worms and Mainz (or the SHUM communities, according to the Hebrew acronym) joined forces in creating a high court for the Jews of Germany. The Jews of Speyer were persecuted in the crusades of 1096 and 1195, in 1282 and 1343, and in the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. By 1500 or 1529, as a result of the expulsions of the 14th and 15th centuries, no Jews lived in Speyer. It was only after 1544 that individual Jews were allowed to settle there, albeit under heavy restrictions. A new Jewish community was established in 1621—47 Jews in 1622, 116 in 1625—but it, too, was expelled in 1688. The modern Jewish community developed during the late 18th century, when the French occupying authorities permitted Jews to settle in Speyer. Available Jewish population figures are as follows: 155 in 1823, 209 in 1830, 535 in 1890, 520 in 1900, 335 in 1825 and 269 in 1930. Of the 122 Jewish households registered there in 1900, 75 were headed by merchants, 14 by industrialists, four by artisans , four by physicians, one by a professor, one by a teacher and 23 by indigent Jews who lived off charitable allowances. Twelve Speyer Jews died fighting for Germany in World War I. After 1811, services were conducted in the community chairman’s home. On June 24, 1837, the community inaugurated a synagogue (on the former St. Jakobskapelle) whose premises included a mikveh (closed in 1875) and a school; the house of worship was enlarged in 1866 and renovated in 1893 and again in 1913. Speyer’s medieval cemetery was confiscated after the expulsion of 1435. The modern community consecrated two cemeteries: the first, located in St. Klara Kloster Weg, in 1829; the second, located inside the city’s general burial grounds, in 1888. Other communal institutions included a school (founded in 1829) whose teacher also served as chazzan and shochet; recognized as a public institution in 1858, the school had 46 pupils on its register in 1897. In 1933, several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community, which belonged to the district rabbinate of Bad Duerkheim. Well into the Nazi period, in July 1936, the community was authorized to establish a Jewish elementary school. Many local Jews left Speyer as a result of the anti-Jewish boycott, but 36 Jewish-owned businesses were still active there in June 1938. On Pogrom Night, rioters burned down the synagogue building, but not before stealing valuable rugs and ritual objects. Jewish homes were ransacked, the cemetery was desecrated and local Jewish men were sent to prison, where 23 were forced to sign over their property to the Nazi Party before being sent to Dachau. After the pogrom, the remaining Jews established a prayer hall in a private residence at 3 Herdstrasse. Speyer’s Jewish population fell from 218 in 1938 to 73 in 1939; most of these Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany. Fifty-one local Jews were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940, after which only nine Jews (patients at the hospital or those who were out of town on the day of the deportation) remained in Speyer; of these, one survived the war in hiding. At least 42 Speyer Jews perished in the Shoah. Founded in 1996, Speyer’s new Jewish community consecrated a cemetery in 1999 and hired its first rabbi in 2002.

Services were conducted in a prayer hall, established in a private residence, until 1825, when the community inaugurated a synagogue on St. Gertrudenstrasse (later renamed Synagogengasse, or “synagogue alley”); the house of worship was renovated in 1886. We also know that Sprendlingen’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in or around 1880. As was the case in many other Jewish communities, the community’s teacher of religious studies also served as chazzan and shochet. In 1920, a window in the synagogue was smashed. Thirty-nine Jews lived in Sprendlingen in 1933; a charitable society was active in the community that year. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters heavily damaged the synagogue and ransacked Jewish homes, including that of a Jewish woman who was married to a Christian. Jewish men were locked in a cowshed, sprayed with water from a hose and, later, sent to a concentration camp. Sold to a carpenter, the synagogue building was eventually converted into a workshop. Sprendlingen’s remaining Jews were deported in 1940. At least 20 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

Services were conducted in a prayer house (at 15 Juedenstrasse, or “Jews’ street”), and we also know that the town was home to a Jewish school (run out of a private residence) in 1838/39. Other Jewish institutions included a cemetery; consecrated on Kraszewskiego Street in 1881, it contained, among others, the headstones of the Oppenheimer family. The Germans destroyed the cemetery during World War II. In 1933, 37 Jews lived in Sprottau, served by a rabbi from Oels. Four Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction at secondary schools that year, by which point the Jews of Primkenau (one), Waltersdorf (two) and Kortnitz (four) had been affiliated with the community. On Pogrom Night (November 9/10, 1938), the prayer room was set on fire and Jewish-owned stores were destroyed. In May 1939, only 13 Jews still lived in Sprottau; and in November 1942, that number was two, both of whom were married to Christians.

Although St. Toenis’ Jewish population of 1933 is not known, the fact that the synagogue was still in use that year indicates that it was considerable. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was broken into by SA men from Huels, who set fire to the building; the structure burned to the ground, as the fire department protected only the surrounding buildings. Jewish-owned businesses were also wrecked that night. The deportations of St. Toenis’ Jews began in 1941. At least 12 Jews from St. Toenis died in the Shoah.

In 1857, Stadthagen’s Jews built a new prayer room at 19 Niedernstrasse; officially opened in 1858, it was acquired by the town’s synagogue community in 1866. The community commenced construction of a new cemetery in 1822. In 1934, windows in two Jewish businesses were smashed and a tear gas bomb was thrown into another; although a member of the SS was arrested for assaulting three Jews—one of whom suffered from epilepsy—he was quickly freed. Later, on November 1, 1938, two Jews were forced to sell their establishment for a ridiculously low price: one of the owners immigrated to Chile; the other was deported to Warsaw on March 30, 1942, where he died.

The Jewish community, founded after 1690, developed into one of the largest in Pomerania. From the 1850s onwards, several Jews served on the city council. Although the synagogue (located at 14-15 Speicherstrasse) was not inaugurated until 1913, the community had, for years, been employing a rabbi, a chazzan and a beadle (who summoned Jews to prayer services by knocking on their doors). The liberal synagogue housed an organ and, in the front building, apartments for the rabbi and the chazzan. Stargard’s Jewish cemetery, consecrated during the 17th century, was located on Kalkenberg. During the years 1921 to 1923, thousands of Eastern European Jews were interned in a camp in Stargard, which had been established by the Weimar government. Many prisoners were mistreated there. In 1932/33, 310 Jews lived in the city. Several welfare and social organizations were active in the Jewish community, among them a branch of the Jewish Women’s League (founded in 1908), the Reisemann Foundation’s old-age home (established in 1899) and a lodge of the Independent Order of B’nai B’rith. A teacher/chazzan instructed Jewish children in religion. In August 1935, anti-Semitic agitation and measures intensified in the town. Later, on Pogrom Night, November 1938, the synagogue was set on fire; Stargard’s fire brigade extinguished the blaze, after which the arsonists blew up the building. Jewish-owned stores were attacked that night, and windows in Jewish homes were broken. Several Stargard Jews managed to immigrate to Shanghai and to other destinations; those who stayed in the city were eventually deported to the Lublin district in Poland. At least 37 Stargard Jews perished in the Shoah.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: DJD, EJL, FJG, GKJP",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1226,1226
Stavenhagen,,32 in 1910,10,"Jews might have lived in Stavenhagen before the 18th century, but the first record of their presence there is from the mid- 1700s. In the early 1800s, the community built a modest synagogue, a community center (alongside the synagogue) and a small cemetery. When the synagogue in nearby Malchin was closed down due to inadequate membership, the two communities merged. On Pogrom Night, the Stavenhagen synagogue and the town’s two remaining Jewish-owned businesses were destroyed. Due to its proximity to other homes, the synagogue was not set on fire. Instead, the SS headed for the cemetery, where they burned down the chapel and desecrated headstones. In early 1939, the synagogue building was appropriated by a furniture manufacturer who used it as a warehouse; it was, however, later abandoned when it became severely dilapidated. As of this writing, a memorial plaque has never been unveiled at the site, now an empty lot. The municipality of Stavenhagen, however, is planning a proper memorial.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1228,1228
Staudernheim,18th century,86 in 1864,21,"The Jews of Staudernheim conducted services on the upper floor of a Jewish-owned business on Hauptstrasse until 1896, when a synagogue was inaugurated at 79 Oberdorf (present-day 3 Am Wolfsgang). The small community was able to maintain a cemetery, which was consecrated in 1850 and enlarged in 1887, a mikveh and a Jewish school. Records suggest that a teacher served the community in the 18th century, and we know for certain that a teacher from nearby Sobernheim later instructed Staudernheim’s Jewish schoolchildren in religion. In 1933, 21 Jews lived in Staudernheim. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s door and windows were smashed, as was the Star of David. The ritual objects, which had been transferred to Sobernheim, were destroyed there that night. Most Jews left Staudernheim; 11 of them immigrated to the United States. One local Jew died from wounds inflicted by Nazi assaulters, three were deported to the East in 1942 and one Jewish woman—she was married to a Christian— survived the war in Staudernheim. At least 12 Staudernheim Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1943, the municipality appropriated the synagogue building, after it was used initially as a soldiers’ club, and later as a center for the air corps’ Hitler youth, a shelter for post-war German refugees and, finally, as a garage.

Jews were, however, expelled from the area soon afterwards, and it was not until the end of the 18th century—prior to which individual Jews had lived there, but never as a community—that Jews were officially permitted to return to the town. The independent Jewish community of Steele was founded on January 1, 1879. Services were conducted in prayer rooms until 1791, when the Jews of Steele rented a building on Kaiser Otto Platz for use as a synagogue. On June 21, 1883, the congregation moved from the dilapidated structure to a new synagogue on Isinger Strasse. We also know that the community maintained a Jewish school and, after 1885, a cemetery at Hiltrops Kamp. As early as 1934, Nazi supporters smashed windows in the synagogue. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue and Jewish school were burned down. In April 1942, the town’s remaining 32 Jews were deported to Izbica, Poland.

The community established a new synagogue (on Fuerstengasse) in the mid-19th century and a cemetery in 1874. The Jewish elementary school, opened on an unspecified date, was closed down in 1924, after which the community employed a teacher of religion who functioned as chazzan and shochet. Local Jews also maintained a mikveh. In 1933, six Jewish children studied religion with a teacher from Neustadt an der Saale. The Jewish cemetery was desecrated in 1935. On November 11, 1938 (two days after Pogrom Night) rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects. Jewish homes and business were attacked and ransacked that day. Twenty-three Steinach Jews emigrated, eight relocated within Germany and five died in Steinach. Two Jews were sent to Wuerzburg in March 1942, and deported from there to Theresienstadt in September of that year. Steinach’s remaining four Jews were deported to Izbica (also via Wuerzburg) in April 1942. At least 34 Steinach Jews perished in the Shoah.

Initially, the Jews of Schwaebisch Hall were members of the Steinbach community. By 1702, local Jews were conducting services in a prayer room. The community’s synagogue, opened in 1809 at 29 Neustetter Strasse, was also attended by the Jews of Schwaebisch Hall, as was the elementary school (which functioned from 1829 until 1869). In 1894, after a prayer hall was opened in Schwaebisch Hall, the two communities decided to alternate services between their respective houses of worship. The cemetery at Steinbacher Strasse was consecrated in 1809. Only two Jews lived in Steinbach in 1924. Years later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned to the ground. The outer walls, however, withstood the blaze, and the site was sold to the municipality in 1939. In 1941, Steinbach’s only remaining Jew, a woman, was deported to Riga. At least seven Steinbach Jews perished in the Shoah. The cemetery, desecrated in 1938, was later destroyed. The municipality sold the former synagogue in 1940, after which a residential house was built on the site. A commemorative plaque was unveiled there, and a memorial was also built at the cemetery.

Steinbach am Glan,18th century,217 in 1848,35,"A Jew lived in Glan-Muenchweiler (whose Jewish community was later affiliated with Steinbach am Glan) in 1638, but it was only in the early 18th century that a Jewish presence was recorded in Steinbach itself. The town’s 18th-century Jewish community consecrated a synagogue (at 78 Hauptstrasse) in 1725 and a cemetery in 1726, the latter of which was enlarged in 1891. Steinbach was home to a Jewish school from 1838 to 1916. In 1933, 35 Jews lived in Steinbach. The community, however, numbered 79 members, as the Jews of Bruecken and Glan-Muenchweile were affiliated with Steinbach. Ten Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction that year. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and ransacked two Jewish homes; Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Later, in July 1939, the municipality bought the synagogue building for a paltry 500 Reichsmarks, from which it deducted 300 Reichsmarks for the demolition costs. Only one Jewish family (of four members) remained in Steinbach after the pogrom; they were deported to Gurs and to Auschwitz on October 22, 1940, and in 1942, respectively. At least one Steinbach Jew perished in the Shoah. In 1941, the municipality sold the synagogue site to a private buyer, after which residential and business quarters were built there.

The community’s Jewish school, opened in the late 1820s, was presided over by a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Steinbach Jews established several other communal institutions: a cemetery in 1780 (located in the middle of town); a synagogue in 1806 (built on the second floor of a half-timbered house on Kirchgasse); and, finally, a mikveh. By the turn of the century, only six Jews lived in Steinbach. The town’s few remaining Jews were persecuted during the Nazi period, and Jewish-owned businesses were boycotted. On November 10, 1938, SA men ransacked the synagogue, threw out the ritual objects and burned them down, broke into and plundered Jewish homes, destroyed the cemetery and took Jewish men into “protective custody.” The synagogue building—POWs were housed there during the war—was torn down in the 1950s.","Fred Gottlieb  Sources: AJ, LJG, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1232,1232
Steinheim,1602,131 in 1855 or 160 in 1885 (sources provide differing information),59,"The presence of Jews in Steinheim was first documented in 1602. In 1808, with the establishment of the consistory of the Kingdom of Westphalia, the Jewish community was recognized as an institution. In 1854, the community became part of a synagogue district that also included other towns in the area, notably Woebel, Belle and Ottenhausen; the Jews from those towns attended services in Steinheim. Steinheim’s Jews conducted services in prayer rooms until either 1756 or 1794, when they inaugurated a synagogue at 90 Rochusstrasse. We also know that a new synagogue was inaugurated on the corner of Markt and Schulstrasse in 1884, and that Steinheim’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in the 19th century. The Jewish population of 1933 was 59. Although services were discontinued in 1936—the last teacher and chazzan had left by that year, and the synagogue property had been sold back in 1930—the house of worship was still vandalized and looted during the late 1930s. On Pogrom Night, SA men tried, unsuccessfully, to break into the synagogue. They were successful the next day, however, and vandalized the interior, threw ritual items onto the streets and transferred the organ to nearby Ottenhausen. In December 1938, the German army completed the destruction with explosives. Seven Jewish men were arrested on Pogrom Night and sent to Buchenwald. The Jewish cemetery was vandalized in 1940. In 1942, 18 Jews were deported to the death camps. At least 32 Steinheim Jews died in the Shoah.

Stendal,1260s,104 in 1892,611,"Although the Jews of Stendal were granted property rights as early as 1297, their subsequent history in the town was turbulent: persecution in 1350, expulsion in 1446, re- admittance in 1453 and another expulsion in 1510. Jews were permitted to return in Stendal during the reign of Elector Joachim II (1535-71)—five Jewish families lived there in 1564—but were expelled yet again after his death. It was not until 1847 that a continuous Jewish presence was established in Stendal. The modern Jewish community, which was affiliated with that of Tangermuende until 1857, hired its own teacher/ cantor in 1861. Local Jews established a synagogue in 1887 and a cemetery (at 3 Uenglingerstrasse) in 1893. In 1932/33 the leader of the community was Jakob Mattischack. That year, Abraham Rathenow, the teacher, instructed four children in religion. On Pogrom Night, rioters wrecked and burned the synagogue. Records from 1939 tell us that only 23 Jews lived in Stendal that year; those who did not escape were, presumably, deported, for only three Jews—they were probably married to Christians—were still living in Stendal in 1942. At least 22 Stendal Jews perished in the Shoah.

In 1935, anti-Jewish demonstrations took place in Stettin and anti-Semitic vitriol was published on an increasingly regular basis. In response to the Nazis’ racial laws, local Jews opened their own elementary school in 1936. In October 1938, Jews of Polish origin were expelled from Stettin. In the early morning of November 10, 1938 (namely, Pogrom Night) members of the Nazi Party set the synagogue on fire; two community members, however, managed to save several Torah scrolls from the blaze. Jewish homes and stores were damaged and looted, the Jewish cemetery and other Jewish institutions were vandalized and Jewish men were taken to Sachsenhausen. The synagogue’s ruins were removed in 1939/40. In 1939, many local Jews immigrated to Shanghai. In February 1940, at least 800 Jews were deported to Lublin, Poland. Children at the Jewish orphanage were taken to Hamburg and Berlin and, later, were deported. The remaining Jews, most of whom were elderly, were deported in 1941/42. Only a few deportees survived the Shoah. After the war, Polish Jews settled in Stettin and founded a new community there. During the pogroms that erupted there in 1946 (the year after the war ended), several Jews were murdered. We also know that, in 1949/50 and especially in 1968, many local Jews immigrated to Israel. In November 1988, a memorial was unveiled at the former cemetery site. The modern Jewish community, founded in 1816 with sixteen Jewish families, built a wooden synagogue on Gruene Schanze in 1834/35; later, in 1875, a new Moorish-style synagogue was built on the site of the old synagogue. The new building—it accommodated 1,600 worshipers and contained an organ—was the largest synagogue in Pomerania; it was renovated on several occasions. It was during the 1820s that the community established a mikveh, a school and a cemetery, the last of which was consecrated on Bethanienstrasse in 1821 and used until 1962. Other communal institutions included a Jewish orphanage, founded in or around 1850, and an Orthodox prayer room, inaugurated by immigrant Jews from Posen and West Prussia in 1867.

The community also maintained a school for religious studies, an elementary school (established in 1854), an old-age home for both Jews and Christians (established in or around the year 1900) and a Jewish cemetery on Freyschmidtstrasse (laid in 1815). Prior to 1815, burials were conducted in Lauenburg. In 1902/1903, the community built a new liberal synagogue at 6 Arnoldstrasse; in the synagogue, which seated 400 men and 300 women, an organ and a mixed choir were part of the religious services. Stolp’s Jewish community center, established near the house of worship, housed three apartments for community officials; the ritual slaughter of poultry was carried out in the building’s courtyard. In 1933, 470 Jews lived in Stolp. Thirty-five schoolchildren received religious instruction that year, and the community was served by a rabbi, a chief chazzan/teacher and a second chazzan/shochet. Several Jewish welfare and social organizations were active in Stolp that year. On the morning of Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire. Policemen and members of the SA prevented the fire brigade from extinguishing the blaze and, after the building had burned to the ground, blew up the ruins. Most of the city’s Jewish men were arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen. After the pogrom, services and classes in religion were held in the community center, which, after 1940, housed the Pomeranian office of the Reich’s Association of the Jews in Germany. By May 1939, approximately half of Stolp’s Jews had emigrated. The remaining Jews were forcibly moved into the community’s old-age home, from which, beginning in 1940, Jews under the age of 50 were taken for forced labor. Deportations commenced in the summer of 1942, and at least 74 Stolp Jews perished in the Shoah. At the end of the war, when Stolp became part of Poland, the entire German population was forced out of the city.

The oldest gravestone in the Jewish cemetery in Stolzenau is dated 1729. We also know that the Stolzenau community, with which the Jews of nearby Landesbergen, Leese and Niendorf were affiliated, established a chevra kadisha in 1860 and a chevra bachurim (boys’ association) in 1890. On Pogrom Night, Nazis smashed the windows of the synagogue and set the building on fire; Torah scrolls and other ritual objects were burned at the market place, a sight that caused the town’s eldest Jewish citizen to suffer a fatal heart attack. Windows in Jewish businesses and homes were broken, but the SA saw to it that no rioters entered the dwellings. Several Jewish men from Stolzenau and Leese were arrested and imprisoned, after which they were presumably deported to Buchenwald.

Jews were influential in the town’s economy: Isaac Friedmann opened the first credit institute in 1863 and later became a delegate to the city parliament. Nevertheless, the Jewish community, always small, did not have enough men for a prayer quorum after 1929. The interior of the synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night, and most of the town’s remaining Jews left during the years that followed. Sixteen Storkow Jews died in the camps. In 1980, a memorial plate was unveiled in the cemetery, which had been renovated by that point. An additional plaque has been affixed to the house of one of Storkow’s deported Jews.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1241,1241
Stralsund,mid 1400s,172 in 1797,160,"The city of Stralsund, founded in the mid-1200s, quickly developed into the most prosperous city in northern Germany. Although Jews were allowed to conduct business in Stralsund, they were forbidden to live in the city. By the mid-1400s, however, Jews had been granted permission to live in Stralsund, albeit in ghettos; this medieval community lived on the Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”), where they consecrated a prayer room. As was the case in towns all over Germany, the Jewish community was expelled from Stralsund in 1492. The year 1757 marked birth of Stralsund’s modern Jewish community. Joachim Giese, a Christian banker who was interested in having Jews manage his financial institutions, was instrumental in obtaining the legal permits that would enable them to live and work in the town. In 1787, one year after receiving permission to build a house of worship, the Jewish community inaugurated a beautiful synagogue with a seating capacity of 200; attached to the synagogue was a mikveh. Stralsund Jews were not particularly affected by the anti- Jewish propaganda of the very early 1930s. From 1933 onwards, however, the situation worsened daily. To enforce the anti-Jewish boycott, Nazis placed troops at the entrances to Jewish-owned businesses, warning people not to shop there. During the years 1933 to 1938, nearly 30 percent of the Jewish population left Stralsund. On Pogrom Night, Jewish-owned businesses were plundered and set on fire. The synagogue was vandalized, after which it, too, was set on fire; it did not completely burn down, however, and was subsequently used by the emergency services as a storage facility. Destroyed during a wartime bombing raid, the building was torn down in 1950. A small memorial plaque was later unveiled in the vicinity of the synagogue site.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SIA, WDJMW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1243,1243
"Straubing with affiliated communities in Deggendorf, Landshut, Vilshofen, Plattling and Passau",13th century,141 in 1910,115,"Although Jews first lived in Straubing in the late 13th century, the town’s modern Jewish community, destroyed during the Nazi period, was established in the late 19th century. The Jews of nearby Deggendorf, Landshut, Vilshofen, Plattling, and Passau were affiliated with the Straubing community from the 19th century onwards. In Straubing, Jews established a prayer hall in 1897; a synagogue, on Wittelsbacher Strasse, in 1907; and a Jewish cemetery in 1923. The community’s Jewish schoolteachers also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, 115 Jews lived in Straubing, 45 in Landshut, 48 in Passau, 21 in Vilshofen, 15 in Deggendorf and 13 in Plattling. Thirteen Jewish schoolchildren studied religion in Straubing, and the community ran a chevra kadisha, a women’s association and a branch of the Keren Kayemet Jewish National Fund for Israel. In March of that year, Nazis murdered a local Jew. The Straubing synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night (November 1938), as were its Torah scrolls and ritual objects. All the town’s Jewish men and several of its Jewish women were arrested, after which some of the men were deported to Dachau. Several men from Vilshofen and Landshut were also deported to Dachau, and Jewish stores and homes were attacked there, too. During the Nazi period, 10 local Jews emigrated from Germany and 19 moved to other German cities. During the years 1942 to 1945, 21 Straubing Jews were deported to Piaski and six to Theresienstadt; eight Deggendorf Jews were deported to the East; from Landshut, 11 Jews were deported to Piaski and one to Theresienstadt; and one Passau Jew was deported to Poland. At least 62 Jews originally from Straubing, 10 from Deggendorf, 58 from Landshut, three from Plattling and two from Vilshofen perished in the Shoah. In 1946, Shoah survivors founded a new Jewish community in Straubing. The synagogue was renovated in 1988, and a new cemetery was established in 2002. A new community was also founded in Landshut. Several memorial plaques were unveiled in Straubing, and Plattling has a memorial stone.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGB, EJL, SIA, SZJLB",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1244,1244
Strausberg,13th century,62 in 1812,,"The number of Jews permitted to reside in Strausberg was strictly limited by the Elector, but after 1670, when Brandenburg was suffering the effects of depopulation caused by the Thirty Years’ War, more Jews were allowed to settle in the town. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1782, and religious services were held in private residences until 1817, when Strausberg’s small Jewish community built a synagogue and community center on Jungferstrasse. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night (November 1938). Jewish homes and the cemetery were vandalized that same night, and Jewish men were arrested. By the early 1940s, only 23 Jews remained in Strausberg; of these, 15 were deported in 1941 and eight in 1942. Several Jews, protected by their marriages to Christians, survived the war in Strausberg. In 1997, plaques were unveiled in the town commemorating the Jewish cemetery and the former synagogue.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1245,1245
Struempfelbrunn,1757,78 in 1836,19,"The Jewish community of Struempfelbrunn initially conducted services in a prayer hall on Kirchenstrasse. In 1831, a synagogue was established on the upper floor of the same house; the ground floor was converted into a teacher’s apartment (the community’s teachers also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers). The community maintained a mikveh, but that was sold and demolished in 1937. Local Jews buried their dead in Hirschhorn and in Boedigheim. By 1933, only 19 Jews lived in Struempfelbrunn. The community suffered severe damage on Pogrom Night: members of the SA and local residents demolished the synagogue’s interior, burned its ritual objects and Torah scrolls (after forcing two Jews to carry the items outside), and then marched through town blowing the shofar in celebration of their crimes. The owner of the Jewish inn was assaulted, and his establishment was set on fire. Jewish men were sent to Dachau that night. Six local Jews emigrated, one died in the town, others relocated within Germany and eight, the last, were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 22 Struempfelbrunn Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue site, which was sold to a local resident on Pogrom Night and subsequently dismantled, is now a garden.

Suedlohn,1903,unknown,unknown,"Suedlohn’s first Jewish family settled there in 1803, after which a Jewish community grew rapidly. During the years 1856 to 1880, Suedlohn, which is part of the nearby town of Stadtlohn, belonged to the regional Jewish congregation of Ahaus. The community regained its independent status in 1880. From 1856 onwards, local Jews maintained their own synagogue. The building—records suggest that it was used as a barn before 1856—was located in a narrow alley between the marketplace and the town’s north wall. The modest synagogue consisted of one room only, with a small staircase leading to the women’s gallery. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on the night of November 10, 1938; tables, chairs, ritual objects, books and documents were set on fire in the marketplace. The severely damaged synagogue building was demolished soon after the pogrom. At the Jewish cemetery—the site was desecrated during the pogrom—gravestones were plundered in 1942. Twenty-five Suedlohn Jews perished during the Shoah.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: SG-NRW, SIA, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1248,1248
Stuttgart,13th century,"4,548 in 1925","4,408","Jews lived in Stuttgart as early as the 13th century; that early community maintained a synagogue and a cemetery. Although the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49 and the expulsion of 1488/98 decimated Stuttgart’s medieval Jewish community, influential court Jews—Joseph “Jud” Suess Oppenheimer and the Kaula family were prominent examples—and their descendants lived in Stuttgart during the centuries that followed. Other Jews were permitted to resettle in Stuttgart in 1806. The community officially founded in 1831 would become Wuerttemberg’s central Jewish community. In 1834, Stuttgart became the headquarters of a district rabbinate. The Stuttgart community, however, employed a separate rabbi. Services were conducted in prayer halls until 1861, when local Jews inaugurated a large, Reform synagogue at 36 Hospitalstrasse; weekday services were conducted in a prayer hall at the community center (at 34 Hospitalstrasse). Stuttgart’s Orthodox Jews founded an Adas Jeschurn association and prayer hall in 1878. Two Eastern European Jewish societies established prayer halls in the early 1900s: Esras Achim at 3 Marienstrasse and Linath Hazedek at 13 Kasernenstrasse (established in 1928). Although Stuttgart was not home to a Jewish elementary school until 1934, the community did maintain a school for religious studies before then. Cemeteries were consecrated in 1834 (in the Hoppenlaufriedhof), in 1874 (in the Pragfriedhof) and in the 1930s (at Steinhaldenfeld). Paul Rieger and Heinemann Auerbach served as rabbis in 1933, and many Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the city that year. The jurist Otto Hirsch (1885-1941) was appointed, in 1933, chairman of the Reich’s Deputation of the German Jews (of which Rabbi Leo Baeck of Berlin was president). In 1935, the Bad Cannstatt Jews became affiliated with the Stuttgart community. Stuttgart’s Orthodox Jews inaugurated a prayer hall at 30 Gartenstrasse in June 1938. The Hospitalstrasse synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. Torah scrolls and ritual objects were destroyed, Jewish homes and businesses were severely damaged, and 800 men were arrested and abused by the mob before being sent to the Welzheim and Dachau camps (two died in Dachau). The Orthodox teacher, his wife and their two children committed suicide a day after the pogrom; another Jew took his own life a few days later. Jewish prisoners were later forced to clear the synagogue ruins. In 1939, those Jews still living in Stuttgart were forcibly moved into designated houses, from which the able-bodied were taken for forced labor in 1940. In 1941, Jewish public worship was outlawed. Approximately 1,342 local Jews emigrated during the years 1933 to 1937. Many others emigrated after 1937, and still others relocated within Germany. Forty-four Stuttgart Jews committed suicide, 14 died in prisons and camps, and 611 were deported in a total of 12 transports, between December 1941 and February 1945, to Riga, Izbica, Auschwitz and Theresienstadt. Among the victims was Otto Hirsch. At least 1,200 Stuttgart Jews perished in the Shoah. Stuttgart’s new Jewish community, founded in 1948, established a prayer hall at 26 Reinsburgstrasse. In 1952, the community built a new house of worship on the site of the former synagogue. Several memorials have been erected in the city to commemorate the Jews of Stuttgart.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, PK BW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1247,1247

(The castles belonged to two different nobles.) Local Jews prayed in nearby Ullstadt, where they also buried their dead, until 1743, when the community received permission to open a prayer room in a private residence and employ an unmarried teacher. In 1756, a synagogue was dedicated at 93 Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley” (later 35 Shlossstrasse). Sugenheim’s Jewish school, first opened in the 19th century, closed in 1924, after which the community employed a teacher who also functioned as chazzan and shochet. In 1933, the community still maintained a chevra kadisha and a branch of the Agudath Israel youth group. Three Jewish children studied religion in Sugenheim, and we also know that the five Jews of Ullstadt were affiliated with the Sugenheim community. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and its ritual objects were destroyed, as was furniture in the defunct Jewish school. At least five Sugenheim Jews emigrated, 12 relocated within Germany, 23 left for unknown destinations and two died in Sugenheim. In January 1939, the last Jew left the village.

Suhl,16th century,150 in 1905,120-160,"Jews were expelled from Suhl during the second half of the 16th century. Another Jewish presence was established there in 1848 and, in 1856, together with the Jews of nearby Heinrichs, the Suhl Jews founded an official community. The community’s registered office was moved from Heinrichs to Suhl in 1871, and religious services were conducted at 7 Muehlplatz. In 1905/06, the community built a synagogue at 13 Hohenlohestrasse (present-day Strasse der Opfer des Faschismus, or “street of the victims of Fascism”). Other communal institutions included a Jewish school and a cemetery, the latter of which was consecrated at Hoheloh and used for burials during the years 1903 to 1941. Several local stores and firms (for example the Simson Works) were owned by Jews. In 1933, Suhl was home between 120 and 160 Jews. A teacher—he also served as chazzan—instructed 12 schoolchildren in religion. A women’s charity association operated a sewing room, and a relief fund supported transient Jews. On Pogrom Night, SA men set the synagogue on fire; a local Jewish man was arrested and abused by the Gestapo. Many Jews left Suhl soon after the pogrom. Later, in 1942, the remaining Jews were deported to Poland and Theresienstadt. At least 49 Suhl Jews perished in the Shoah.

In 1950, the municipality returned the synagogue site to the official Jewish community of the Rhine-Palatinate region, which put the site up for sale in 1975.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, FGW, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1260,1260
Templin,1309,30 in 1880 or 1890,unknown,"Although we know that Jews lived in Templin in 1309, records are silent about a Jewish presence there during the centuries that followed. In 1860, Templin’s few Jewish families established a synagogue on the plot of a halftimbered, rustic house on Berlinerstrasse. The small Jewish cemetery on Bahnhofstrasse, just within the city’s limits, was probably consecrated during the 18th century. Even though the community never exceeded 30 members, the congregation conducted services until the 1920s, at which point the community—battered by the upheavals of World War I, by the ensuing economic depression, and by the decision of many local Jews to leave for Berlin—discontinued synagogue services. In 1928, the community rented out the synagogue building to an Adventist congregation. The fact that the synagogue was no longer used by the community did not save it from of the wrath of local ant- Semites on Pogrom Night, when the building was vandalized and burned down. At the cemetery, tombstones were smashed into pieces; today, a memorial plaque marks its centurieslong existence. A commemorative plaque was affixed to the building on whose grounds the synagogue once stood, but it has since disappeared.","Harold Slutzkin  Sources: LJG, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1259,1259
Thalmaessing,mid-15th century,227 in 1743,33,"Thalmaessing was home to one of the most important and affluent Jewish communities in the Ansbach princedom. The community established a synagogue on the corner of Ringstrasse and Merleingasse in 1690; a cemetery near Bachstrasse in 1832; a building for the community’s Jewish school (at 10 Schulgasse, or “school alley”) in 1840; and a new synagogue in 1857/58. Local Jews also maintained a mikveh. Five Jewish children studied religion with the teacher/ chazzan in 1933. A women’s association and a chevra kadisha were active in Thalmaessing that year. In 1937, when the community was officially dissolved, Thalmaessing’s synagogue closed down; its ritual objects and Torah scrolls were transferred to the association of Bavarian Jewish communities in Munich. The municipality eventually appropriated the Thalmaessing school building. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and its furnishings and remaining ritual objects were destroyed. Thirteen Thalmaessing Jews emigrated and 20 relocated within Germany. By May 1939, all Jewish residents had left Thalmaessing. At least 34 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1945, a U.S. soldier, son of a former local Jew, forced Nazi party members to restore the damaged Jewish cemetery. The synagogue, later used as a silo and then as a gym, was demolished in 1970/73 to make room for an apartment building. A memorial plaque has been unveiled near the synagogue site.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGB, EJL, PK-BAV, SZJLB",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1263,1263
Teterow,1492,116 in 1845,17,"The earliest record of the Jews of Teterow is dated 1492, the same year in which five Jews were burned at the stake and the rest were banished. Records do not mention another Jewish presence in Teterow until 1762, when a Jewish community was founded there. Although troops were posted in Teterow to enforce the anti-Jewish ordinances of 1933, the local population ignored them. Eventually, however, the situation deteriorated to such an extent that by 1935, the Jewish community was forced to disband. On Pogrom Night, the abandoned synagogue was ransacked and the roof trusses were torn down. A few weeks later, the city declared the building unsafe and a danger to pedestrians, after which it was torn down. The Jewish cemetery was left unharmed, as it was located outside the city. A memorial plaque was later unveiled at the site where the synagogue once stood. Another plaque has been placed at the cemetery, which is considered one of the best-preserved Jewish cemeteries in the area.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG, SIA, WDJMV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1261,1261
Thalfang,unknown,113 in 1843 (21% of the total population),37,"The Jews of Thalfang and its nearby villages belonged to the community of Trier until 1920, when Thalfang was recognized as an independent Jewish community. Local Jews consecrated a cemetery in 1800 and a synagogue—it housed a schoolroom and a teacher’s apartment—in 1822 (renovated in 1867). Thirty-seven Jews lived in Thalfang in 1933. The Jews of Talling, Dhronecken, Berglicht and Deuselbach were affiliated with the Thalfang community. In 1938, 22 Jews still lived in Thalfang. On Pogrom Night, rioters smashed the synagogue’s windows, threw out the benches and ritual objects and, in a particularly crude show of contempt, hurled the curtains and candle holders onto a nearby manure heap. The Jews themselves were forced to take the sacred books to the marketplace and burn them there. Thalfang’s Jewish cemetery was also desecrated that night. Twelve Jews emigrated, 19 relocated within Germany and nine, Thalfang’s last, were deported to the Lodz ghetto in October 1942. At least 21 Thalfang Jews perished in the Shoah. Several gravestones removed during the Nazi period were returned to the cemetery in 1945. In 1950, the Jewish regional community sold the synagogue building to a neighbor, who had it torn down in 1956.

Theilheim,17th century,225 in 1867 (42% of the total population),70,"Theilheim’s first synagogue was built in 1751. The community maintained a mikveh, a community center and a Jewish school, the last of which was housed in the community center and presided over by a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1851, a new synagogue was built at 21-23 von Erthal-Strasse. Burials were conducted in Schwanfeld. Twelve local Jewish children studied religion in 1933; a chevra kadisha and a women’s association were active in the village that year. In 1938, the Jewish school became an elementary school for Jewish pupils who had been expelled from German schools. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire: the building survived the blaze, but its furniture, Torah scrolls, and ritual objects were burned. Jewish homes were ransacked, the community center was wrecked and two Theilheim Jews were imprisoned in Schweinfurt. Thirty-one Theilheim Jews emigrated (24 went to the United States), two relocated within Germany and one committed suicide. In April 1942, 31 were deported, via Wuerzburg, to Izbica; nine others were deported to Theresienstadt, also via Wuerzburg, in September 1942. One Jew still lived in Theilheim in 1942, but his fate is unknown. At least 64 Theilheim Jews perished in the Shoah.

Thuengen,16th century,350 in 1837,152,"The Jewish community of Thuengen conducted services in a prayer hall during the 17th century. In the 1860s, the community replaced its 18th-century synagogue with a building that contained a new synagogue, a schoolroom and a teacher’s apartment. The community also maintained a mikveh and a school (in the 19th century), the latter of which was presided over by teachers who also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers. Burials were conducted in Laudenbach. Fifteen Jewish pupils attended the school in 1933. The community ran several welfare and educational associations that year. In 1938, anti-Jewish riots broke out on the eve of the annexation of Austria by the German Reich (in March) and again during the Sudeten crisis. Windows in Jewish-owned homes were smashed, and many residents left in the wake of both incidents. Although the synagogue was not harmed on Pogrom Night, it was attacked in 1938 and its contents, as well as the school building, were destroyed. The majority of Thuengen’s Jews left between the years 1937 and 1939. Of these, 110 emigrated and 56 relocated within Germany. In February 1942, the village’s last three Jews were deported to Izbica. At least 72 Thuengen Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was used as a factory until the 1980s, when it was converted into an apartment building.

All that we know for certain, in fact, is that Thuer’s Jews established a prayer room and a cemetery in the early 1800s. In 1864, the Jews of Thuer, together with Jews from the neighboring villages of Kottenheim, Niedermendig and Obermendig, founded a joint Jewish community. One synagogue was to serve all three villages, but the three groups bickered for years about where the house of worship would be built. Finally, in 1866, the community decided to build two synagogues: one in Thuer (serving the Jews of Thuer and Kottenheim), the other in Niedermendig (serving the Jews of Niedermendig and Obermendig). On Pogrom Night, the synagogue in Thuer was vandalized and destroyed.

Between 1865 and 1877, local Jews conducted services in prayer rooms. The modern Jewish community of Themar was established in 1877, the same year in which a synagogue was dedicated at 205 Oberstadt (presentday 17 Ernst Thaelmann Strasse). In 1894, a school and a teacher’s apartment were built on the synagogue’s first floor. We also know that local Jews conducted burials in Marisfeld. In 1933, at least 64 Jews lived in Themar. A shochet served the community, and seven Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction. A funeral fund, which helped families finance burials, was active in the community that year. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior was vandalized; 18 men were arrested and deported to Buchenwald (where one died). The synagogue was eventually sold. By 1939, 21 local Jews had emigrated from Germany. Of those deported in 1942, at least twenty perished in the Shoah. Themar’s last Jew was arrested in 1943. The synagogue building was used as a school after 1945, and as an apartment building after 1950.

Tiengen,14th century (recorded in 1454),233 in 1880,46,"The Jewish community of Tiengen established a cemetery on Feldbergstrasse in or around the year 1760. Religious services were conducted in prayer rooms until 1793, when a synagogue was dedicated on Fahrgasse (the cemetery was renovated in 1863 and again in 1929). The community maintained a mikveh, built in 1867, and a Jewish elementary school (1830-1876). After the school shut down, a private teacher instructed Jewish schoolchildren in religion; in Tiengen, teachers also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers. In 1933, Jewish associations, branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations and charity funds were active in Tiengen. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the cemetery and the synagogue’s interior. Jewish homes and businesses were looted and vandalized. Five Jewish men and 14 women were arrested; the men were sent to Dachau, where two died. Sold in 1939, the synagogue was converted into a workshop. Thirty Jews emigrated, at least nine relocated within Germany and five, all women, were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 23 Tiengen Jews perished in the Shoah. The cemetery (it had been converted into a sports field) was restored after the war: the site now contains a memorial plaque (unveiled in 1981) and monument (erected in 2002).

Tilsit,1811,approximately 800 in 1928,approximately 640,"In early 1840, when Jews formally established a community in Tilsit (present-day Sovetsk, in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia), they immediately found themselves in dire need of a large synagogue, as the Jewish population had swelled to 265 and was rapidly growing. Construction of a synagogue on the corner of Kirchen and Rosenstrasse began in 1841; the house of worship was completed and inaugurated one year later. On holy days, Jews from the surrounding villages attended services in Tilsit. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated there in 1825. The unusually rapid growth of Tilsit’s Jewish population was in part due to the geographic location of town: after the realignment of national boundaries following World War I, Tilsit found itself on the Lithuanian border. Many Lithuanians, among them Jews, brought cheap goods from Russia and sold them in Tilsit. These merchants used the synagogue regularly and many decided to settle in the town. They were joined by tens of thousands of Russian and Lithuanian Jews fleeing from pogroms who, seeing that Jews lived in Tilsit peacefully, decided to build their new homes there instead of immigrating to Palestine or to the United States (Tilsit was a transfer point on the immigration route); the Association of East Prussian (Jewish) Communities opened an office in Tilsit to assist these Jewish migrants. Anti-Semitism escalated in Tilsit during the early 1930s: the synagogue and cemetery were desecrated on many occasions, a curfew was imposed on the Jewish population, Jews were humiliated and assaulted on the streets and Jewish-owned businesses were boycotted. The leaders of the community saw the writing on the wall and joined the German Zionist movement in urging Jews to immigrate to Palestine. Recruitment centers were set up, and courses in language, culture, industry and commerce were offered with the aim of preparing Jews for a new life in Palestine. Those Jews who had not left Tilsit by the early 1940s were deported; in 1944, only 31 Jews—they were, presumably, married to Christians—lived in Tilsit. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire and destroyed, as were a number of Jewish-owned businesses. The synagogue was eventually converted into a Russian Orthodox church.","Moshe Finkel  Sources: EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1269,1269
Tirschtiegel,1745,unknown,,"Although it is likely that Jews lived in Tirschtiegel (presentday Trzciel, Poland) in the 17th century, the earliest record of their presence there is dated 1745. Approximately 250 Jews, most of whom were poor, lived in Tirschtiegel in the late 18th century (253 in 1772), at which point plans for the construction of a synagogue were drawn up. Beginning in 1789, the community employed a rabbi. The town was home to a Jewish school (founded in the 19th century); the school was closed down shortly before World War I as a result of low enrollment numbers. Tirschtiegel’s Jewish population dropped markedly during the early 1930s. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters torched the synagogue and demolished the town’s last Jewishowned house. Later, in the spring of 1940 (a slave labor camp for Jews had been established in Tirschtiegel at the beginning of the war) the remaining Jews were interned in a camp near Schneidemuehl and were, later, deported to the East.

Some years later, the authorities rescinded the ban on Jewish settlement. The Jewish community’s first synagogue was established in 1830, the same year in which local Jews consecrated a cemetery. Later, in response to the growth of the Jewish population, the community decided to build a new house of worship (inaugurated on the eve of the Jewish New Year, 1871). It was during the early 1900s, however, that Trebnitz’s Jewish population began to dwindle. As was the case in many other German towns, the year 1930 marked the beginning of relentless anti-Semitism in Trebnitz: headstones at the Jewish cemetery were desecrated with swastikas, and Nazi slogans were painted on the burial ground’s outer walls. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), Nazis destroyed the synagogue and the town’s three remaining Jewish-owned businesses.

The increase in Trachenberg’s Jewish population highlighted a pressing problem—the absence of a Jewish cemetery in the town. In 1822, the city authorities allocated, free of charge, a plot of land for this purpose. Local Jews held religious services in a small prayer room until 1861 when, because the community had exceeded 100 members, it purchased a site near the train station and built a synagogue there; the inauguration ceremony took place in 1861.

Trier,1066,852 in 1885,796,"The first explicit written reference to the Jews of Trier is dated 1066. The community, one of the most important during the Middle Ages, was home to many prominent rabbis and scholars. Local Jews initially lived in a Jewish quarter and maintained all the necessary communal institutions: a synagogue, a cemetery and a mikveh. The community was persecuted in 1096 (the First Crusade) and in 1348/49 (the Black Death pogroms), and expelled from the city in 1351 and again in 1418. Later, in the early 17th century, a new Jewish community was established there, but it, too, was persecuted during the anti-Jewish riots of 1675/76, during which time the synagogue was damaged. The Jews of Trier established several communal institutions during the ensuing centuries: a cemetery (in the 1650s); a synagogue (in 1762); a mikveh (in 1785); a new synagogue on Zuckerbergstrasse (in 1859); a Jewish elementary school (in 1825); and, finally, a new cemetery (in 1925). From the early 18th century onwards, Trier was the headquarters of a district rabbinate; Shemuel Levi Marx, grandfather of Karl Marx, served as district rabbi from 1804 until 1827. In 1879, Orthodox Jews founded their own Israelite Religious Association, after which they appointed their own rabbi. In 1882, the Orthodox community inaugurated a synagogue—it also maintained a prayer hall at 17 Nagelstrasse—and a school. Later, in 1891, the two religious factions (the Orthodox community and the mainstream community) agreed to hire one rabbi. Dr. Adolf Altmann was the community’s rabbi in 1933. Forty-nine pupils attended the Jewish elementary school that year, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community. Jews were persecuted in Trier after the Nazis rose to power, but the community actually expanded its cultural and social activities during the years leading up to Pogrom Night (November 1938), when the synagogue was burned together with its 24 Torah scrolls. Jewish homes and businesses were vandalized that night, and more than 100 men were arrested and held at the local prison for a month. Rabbi Altmann immigrated to the Netherlands at some point after the pogrom, from where he was later deported to Auschwitz and murdered. Trier’s Jewish school closed down in 1941. In October 1941, 100 local Jews were deported to the Lodz ghetto; in 1942, 98 were deported to the Lublin district, to Auschwitz and to Theresienstadt and, in March 1943, 91 were deported to unknown destinations. Several Jews, all of whom were married to Christians, survived the war in Trier. At least 394 Trier Jews perished in the Shoah. The new Jewish community of Trier, founded in 1945, inaugurated a new synagogue (at 25 Kaiserstrasse) in 1957. A city street was named after Rabbi Altmann in 1958, and several memorial plaques have been unveiled in honor of Trier’s Shoah victims.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, EJL, EUJST",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1278,1278
Tuebingen,1335,139 in 1910,88,"Jews were expelled from Tuebingen in 1348/49, in 1456 and again in 1477. In 1848, Jews once again established a presence in the town as members of the Jewish community of Wankheim. The community’s headquarters were moved to Tuebingen in 1882. Local Jews attended services at the Wankheim synagogue until 1882, when the community inaugurated a synagogue at 33 Gartenstrasse. Jewish schoolchildren studied religion under the guidance of teachers who also served as cantors and ritual slaughterers. Burials were conducted in Wankheim. Fourteen schoolchildren studied religion in Tuebingen in 1933, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the town. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night; Torah scrolls and ritual objects were thrown into the Neckar River, after which the synagogue building was burned down. Five Jews were sent to Dachau. Sixty-eight local Jews emigrated, 49 relocated within Germany, ten died in the town, two committed suicide and 14, the last, were deported to Riga, Izbica, Theresienstadt and Auschwitz in 1941 and 1942. At least 42 Tuebingen Jews perished in the Shoah. A plaque was unveiled opposite the former synagogue site in 1983.

Twistringen,1730,40 in 1858,unknown,"Twistringen’s synagogue association, which included the Jews living in nearby Heiligenloh and Ehrenburg, was established in 1843. In 1845, the community acquired a building in Twistringen in which it established a synagogue and a school, the latter of which had been operating at a different location since 1830. We also know that this community maintained a mikveh and, after 1789, a cemetery just north of Twistringen. The Jewish school closed down in 1860, and although another was established in 1888, it, too, closed down in 1904. In 1907/08, Twistringen’s Jewish children studied religion in Bassum with a teacher from Barenburg; later, they studied with a teacher from Diepholz. In 1932, one local child received religious instruction, then provided in Twistringen itself. On the morning of November 10, 1938, male Jews were arrested and imprisoned in the fire department’s building. Valuables were stolen from Jewish homes and documents pertaining to the community, placed in the kosher butcher’s home for safekeeping, were confiscated. SA men then set fire to the synagogue. Several Jewish men were transferred to the prison in Hanover and, later, to Buchenwald, from where they were released in late November 1938. Eight Jews lived in Twistringen in 1939. In 1941, the few who remained were made participate in forced labor. Then began the deportations to Minsk, Warsaw, Auschwitz and Riga; records suggest that the last deportation was that of Alma and Sophie Goldberg in 1943. At least 20 Twistringen Jews perished in the Shoah. In May 1985, a memorial stone was unveiled on Bachstrasse, near the former synagogue site.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: EJL, JGNB, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1280,1280
Ulm,1241,694 in 1880,530,"A medieval Jewish community was expelled from Ulm in 1499. Jews re-established a presence there in 1782, founding an official community in 1857. In 1880, one year after the birth of Ulm native Albert Einstein, the community recorded a peak Jewish population of 694. Ulm’s medieval Jewish community had maintained a synagogue, a mikveh, a school and two cemeteries. The modern Jewish community established the following institutions: a prayer hall in 1845; a cemetery in 1852; a Jewish community center—located on Weinhof, it housed a school and a teacher’s apartment—in 1868/9; a Reform synagogue, established within the community center in 1873 (renovated in 1928); and, finally, a district rabbinate in 1889. Ulm’s Orthodox Jews maintained their own prayer hall. In 1933, 530 Jews lived in Ulm. Seventy-four Jewish schoolchildren studied religion, and several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the city. The synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night. Jews were taken to the Weinhof square, were assaulted by a mob and maltreated at the police station. Jewish-owned businesses were vandalized and looted, and 38 Jewish men were sent to Dachau, where one died (another died after his release). The synagogue’s ruins were demolished shortly afterwards at the community’s expense. Ulm’s Jewish cemetery was destroyed during the Nazi period. Three hundred and thirty-one Jews emigrated from Ulm (among them Richard Strauss, the founder of the State of Israel’s Strauss dairy concern). Others relocated within Germany, 39 died in Ulm and 98 were deported to Riga, Izbica and Theresienstadt between the years 1941 and 1945. At least 118 Ulm Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1958, a bank was built on the site of the former synagogue; a plaque was later unveiled there. A memorial was erected on Weinhof in 1988. The cemetery is now a park.

Uerdingen,14th century,79 in 1848,31,"Uerdingen, which is now a municipality of Krefeld, was once home to an independent Jewish congregation. We know little about the community’s origins, but records do tell us that Jews were persecuted in Uerdingen during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. Records also suggest that communal life was re-established in the early 19th century. In 1841, the Jewish community established a synagogue in the rear section of a building at 6 Bruchstrasse. When Uerdingen was annexed to Krefeld, local Jews actively protested, arguing that their community’s observant members would not be able to walk the greater distance to the synagogue. Their petition was rejected, however, and in 1854 the Uerdingen Jewish community was affiliated with that of Krefeld. On the night of November 9, 1938 (Pogrom Night) the interior of the local Uerdingen synagogue was ravaged and the equipment and furniture were set on fire in the marketplace; several sources claimed that the synagogue was torn down. At the former synagogue building, which has been used as a residence since 1939, a memorial plaque has been unveiled.","Ruth Martina Trucks  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1283,1283

Burials were conducted in nearby Hamme until 1855, when a cemetery was established in Uchte (the cemetery was used until 1933). We also know that in 1863, a teacher from Diepenau was hired to instruct six Uchte children in religion. The Jews of Uchte, Warmsen, Meierhof and Stueriede formed an official synagogue association in 1882, after which the provincial rabbinate in Hanover provided funds for the religious instruction of the association’s schoolchildren. From the 1920s onwards, if not earlier, the prayer room was located on Brinkstrasse, in Uchte. In 1928, 29 Jews belonged to the Uchte-Warmsen synagogue association; by 1938, seven Uchte Jews had moved to other locations. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), several Jewish men were arrested and sent to the Buchenau concentration camp; they were released from the camp only after their wives, who had been imprisoned in Hanover, declared their intention to leave Germany. Two Jewish residences were ransacked that night. One family managed to immigrate to the United States, another immigrated to Venezuela and a Jewish youth made it to England on a children’s transport. We also know that one family was deported to Riga in 1941, that a Jewish girl was sent to Stutthof on an unspecified date, and that a married couple was deported to Minsk; records are silent about their fate. A local Jewish couple, sent to Warsaw on March 31, 1942, was declared dead after the Shoah, as was a couple who had been sent to Theresienstadt on July 23, 1942. According to Yad Vashem, five Uchte-Warmsen Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was later used for residential purposes.

Uehlfeld,16th century,325 in 1832 (47.3% of the total population),49,"The Jewish community of Uehlfeld established a synagogue in 1696, a cemetery on Zeckenberg in 1732, a public elementary school in 1813 (it closed in 1924) and a new synagogue at 7 Raiffeisenstrasse in 1818. The synagogue burned down in 1888, after which, in 1889, the community inaugurated a new synagogue with a mikveh. From 1924 onwards, local Jews employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. In 1933, four Jewish children studied religion in Uehlfeld; a women’s association and a chevra kadisha were active in Uehlfeld that year. On November 8, 1938, the Nazi leader in nearby Neustadt an der Aisch ordered Uehlfeld’s 15 remaining Jews to leave town within 24 hours and to sell their property within eight days. Two days later, on Pogrom Night, the homes of those Jews who were still there and the synagogue were destroyed (the latter was burned to the ground). All Uehlfeld Jews escaped that day, but the Jewish wife of a Christian resident returned two months later. Between 1933 and 1938, seven Uehlfeld Jews immigrated to the United States, 31 relocated within Germany and four died in Uehlfeld. At least 60 Uehlfeld Jews perished in the Shoah.

Unna,1304,240 in 1909,156,"Records from the 15th century mention the occasional Jewish visitor in Unna, but the town’s Jewish population was then limited by decree to no more than six families. Twelve Jewish families lived in Unna in 1821, and in 1854 an official Jewish congregation was established there. Most local Jews were merchants. Religious services were conducted in a prayer room until 1805, when the community acquired a house on Hertinger Strasse and converted it into a synagogue. The dilapidated structure was abandoned three years later, after which congregants conducted services in several unspecified locations. Finally, in 1848, a chapel on Klosterstrasse was converted into a synagogue and school (both were opened in 1851). We also know that the community maintained an oldage home—established on Muehlenstrasse in 1905, it had its own cemetery—as well as an organization for hosting Jewish guests and a ritual burial association. The cemetery on Massener Strasse, consecrated in 1854 and desecrated in 1900, was used until 1942. Anti-Semitism flourished in Unna after World War I. Many local Jews left the town after April 1, 1933, when the Nazis implemented their anti-Jewish boycott. On Pogrom Night (November 1938) SA men demolished Jewish homes and destroyed furniture from the synagogue, from the school and from Jewish-owned shops. In 1939, Unna’s remaining Jews were moved into a few apartments and the old-age home. Although we do not know how many Jews lived in Unna in 1942, records do tell us that they were deported to Zamosc and to Theresienstadt that year. One hundred and fifty local Jews perished in the Shoah. Sold in 1956, the synagogue building was eventually converted into a printing shop. Commemorative plaques have been affixed to the building and to the house on Muehlenstrasse; at the cemetery, two memorial stones commemorate local Shoah victims. Many Jews from the former Soviet Union lived in a hostel in Unna during the 1990s.

In 1863, Jews from Linz and Unkel formed the Linz-Unkel synagogue association. The community established the following institutions: a synagogue in 1856; a cemetery, on Am hohen Weg, in 1870; a mikveh (located in a private residence); and a new synagogue, at 28 Am Graben (on the corner of Graben and Freiligrath Strasse) in 1874. Five Jews lived in Unkel in 1933. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), two villagers procured the key to the synagogue and set fire to the building, which burned down completely. In 1939, when only three Jews lived in Unkel, the synagogue was sold into private ownership, after which a residence was built on the site. By the end of 1942, the last three Jews had left Unkel; records indicate that they were deported. At least three Unkel Jews perished in the Shoah.

The Unteraltertheim community employed a teacher of religion who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Unteraltertheim’s teacher also served the Jews of nearby Oberaltertheim. The community buried its dead in Wenkheim. In 1933, a teacher from Wenkheim instructed four Unteraltertheim schoolchildren. In Unteraltertheim, the riots of November 1938, took place on the 11th, two nights after Pogrom Night. Rioters in Unteraltertheim attacked Jewish homes, broke the machinery in a Jewish-owned bakery and destroyed the synagogue’s interior and contents (including two Torah scrolls). All Jewish men were arrested, and one was deported to Buchenwald. After the pogrom, the synagogue was sold, for one-third of its actual value, to the village authorities. Nine Unteraltertheim Jews emigrated and three relocated within Germany. In September 1939, the remaining Jews were forced to move into one house. One Jew was deported to Mauthausen, where he died in 1940, and 16 were deported to Izbica in April 1942. At least 37 local Jews perished in the Shoah.

The community consecrated a cemetery in 1920, prior to which burials were conducted in Weitersburg. In 1933, 12 Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction. A Jewish women’s association and a society for Jewish history and literature were active in the community. On Pogrom Night, SA men vandalized the synagogue and forced Jewish men to carry the Torah scrolls to the police headquarters. Two days later, the synagogue and Torah scrolls were burned, but not before the Gestapo had confiscated valuable ritual objects. Jewish-owned homes and businesses were damaged, and Jewish men were arrested. Forty-one Jews, the town’s last, were deported to the East in 1942. At least 89 Vallendar Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1957, the synagogue site was sold to a metalworker who subsequently erected a residential building and workshop there. A memorial plaque was unveiled at the site in 1987; and in 1991, the extant synagogue ruins—mainly its eastern wall—were incorporated into a memorial.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AJ, EJL, FGW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1295,1295
Vechta,1709,59 in 1850,unknown (19 in 1932),"Although records from 1784 and 1803 refer to a synagogue in Vechta, they do not mention when or where it was established. We know for certain, however, that in 1825 the Jewish community acquired a synagogue building—which also housed a school and an apartment for the teacher—on Klingenhagen (later, Juttastrasse). Vechta’s Jewish cemetery on Bergstruper Weg was probably consecrated in the early 1700s. In 1932, 19 Jews lived in Vechta, as well as five in nearby Lohne and one in Goldenstedt (the last two were affiliated communities). Later, in 1935, the synagogue building was remodeled to provide a residence for a Jewish family by the name of Marx. When the SA broke into the synagogue on Pogrom Night, they not only smashed the windows, but also destroyed and plundered both the synagogue and the Marx residence, after which they burned everything at the new market place (Neumarkt). Jewish-owned businesses, homes and the cemetery were severely vandalized. The Marx family found refuge with the Gerson family after the pogrom. Eventually sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, Emanuel and Adolf Gerson were released. Adolf Gerson, who became president of the synagogue congregation in 1937, managed to escape to Palestine; in Bremen, Emanuel Gerson was arrested trying to board a ship to America; he committed suicide in a Hamburg prison in June 1940. In 1939, at which point only nine Jews lived in Vechta, the community sold the synagogue to private buyers. At least seven former residents of Vechta perished in the Shoah. The cemetery has been restored as far as was possible; in 1981 a memorial stone was unveiled not far from the former synagogue building.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: JGNB1, YV  www.geschichtsatlas.de/~gb21/Projekt/Juden/juden-end.htm",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1297,1297
Varel,1683,90 in 1875,39,"The Jews of Varel initially conducted services in a rented prayer room, first documented in 1717. The community unsuccessfully petitioned the authorities for a synagogue in 1760, and it was not until 1806, when a local Jew, Abraham Schwabe, provided the community with a building, that a synagogue was established in Varel. This synagogue had been abandoned by 1843, as the structure had fallen into disrepair. Later, on July 28, 1848, the community inaugurated a synagogue on Osterstrasse; the building, which had been acquired in 1840, housed an elementary school, an apartment for the teacher and a mikveh. Records also tell us that in 1900, the community opened a hostel for indigent Jews. Varel’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1711. Seventeen Jews lived in Varel on Pogrom Night (November 1938), when SA troops set the synagogue on fire and plundered the remaining Jewish homes. Jewish men and several women were imprisoned in police headquarters, from where they were sent to Oldenburg and, later, to Sachsenhausen, where one man was so badly beaten that he died of his wounds. Those who survived the ordeal were eventually released, after which eight more Varel Jews emigrated from Germany. Varel’s last Jewish family left town in 1940. On July 23, 1941, after the remaining Jewish residents of the old-age home were deported to Theresienstadt, the town was declared Judenfrei (“free of Jews”). Approximately 43 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The site of the Jewish cemetery was taken over by the Nazis, who used some of the gravestones for construction; several gravestones were retrieved after the war. The synagogue site was acquired by a local resident in May 1939. In 1990, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the public school opposite the plot where the synagogue once stood.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: JGNB1, YV  www.bethhahayim.info/varel.htm",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1296,1296

A Jewish cemetery was consecrated on Kirrweiler Strasse in 1887, near the Christian cemetery. The Jews of Kirrweiler and Altdorf were affiliated with the Venningen community in 1894 and 1916, respectively. On Pogrom Night, the interior of Venningen’s synagogue was destroyed, after which all but one Jewish couple either emigrated from or relocated within Germany. On October 22, 1942, the town’s two remaining Jews were deported to the Gurs concentration camp in France. At least 13 Venningen Jews perished in the Shoah. Between 1942 and 1945, POWs were housed in the former synagogue. The building was returned to the regional Jewish community in 1950; in 1952, the community sold the property to a tailor who subsequently converted it into a residence.

Verden an der Aller,1571,120 in 1875,78,"On January 31, 1858, Verden an der Aller’s Jewish community inaugurated its first synagogue at 7 Johanniswall; the building also housed a school and a mikveh. Jewish burials took place in Hoyerhagen until 1834, when a cemetery was consecrated in Verden. Although many Jews left Verden after 1933, a Jewish youth group continued to organize classes in Hebrew and Jewish history; on Sabbath afternoons, youths organized a minyan. On October 28, 1938, David Gruenfeld, a teacher of religion who had been born in Poland, was deported to his country of birth. Later, on Pogrom Night, rioters smashed windows in Jewish-owned businesses. At approximately five o’clock in the morning, SA men, most likely from the Etelsen Fuehrer School, ransacked the synagogue and set it on fire. Thirteen Jewish men were arrested and imprisoned for two or three weeks, after which they were forced to leave Verden. The synagogue’s ruins were leveled, and the community was forced to sell the property. Twelve Jews managed to flee after Pogrom Night. On November 17, 1941, at least 20 Jews were deported to Minsk, where all but one were killed. One local Jew—he was married to a Catholic resident—survived the war in Verden. Of those Jews who still lived in Verden in 1938, at least 29 perished in the Shoah. Three Jews returned to Verden after the war. The cemetery was vandalized in 1960. In 1966, in memory of the former synagogue, a memorial plaque was affixed to the Johanniswall; in 1993, a monument was unveiled at the town hall in memory of Verden’s murdered Jews.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: EJL, JGNB1",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1300,1300
Versmold,late 17th century,65 in 1860,31,"Although Jews settled in Versmold in the late 17th century, it was not until the early 19th century that a functioning Jewish community was founded there. Local Jews shared their cemetery with the Bergholzhausen community. We also know that Versmold’s Jews rented a room for religious gatherings at some point during the 1830s, around which time the authorities approved the community’s request to build a synagogue. The implementation of these plans, however, proved to be complicated: when construction was halted, rumors were spread that Christian blood was required for its completion. Although the use of the building as a synagogue was later prohibited, it was nevertheless used secretly for prayer services after its consecration in 1900 (it seated 30 congregants). In Versmold, Jewish children received religious instruction from traveling tutors. In 1936, students broke into the synagogue and vandalized its interior. By 1938, all but one Jewish family had fled Versmold. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned—a residential building was later erected on its site—and the town’s three remaining Jews were deported to Theresienstadt. They never returned.

The community belonged to the synagogue district of Gladbeck until 1931, when it was recognized as an independent Jewish community. Viersen’s Jews conducted services in prayer halls until they acquired a building at 10 Rektoratsstrasse in 1862, in which the ground floor housed the Jewish school and the upper floor the synagogue. Jewish cemeteries were consecrated near Rahserstrasse (on the outskirts of town) and at Auf der Loeh, the latter of which was established at some point after 1907. In 1933, the synagogue district to which Viersen’s Jewish community belonged numbered 492 members. The town’s Jewish school was shut down in 1932. In Viersen, the boycott of Jewish-owned businesses was enforced zealously, with members of the SA and SS damaging Jewish property as early as 1933. On Pogrom Night, Jewish homes were vandalized and Jewish men were jailed in Anrath. The synagogue’s inventory was confiscated and stored in a local history museum, which was destroyed during the war. Both the synagogue and the cemetery were appropriated by the municipality. Most Jews left Viersen after Pogrom Night; only 48 still lived there in 1939. Deportations from Viersen began in 1941; according to Yad Vashem, at least 147 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The site of the former cemetery contains a memorial plaque.

Vilbel,17th century,120 in 1850,75,"The Jewish community of Vilbel (present-day Bad Vilbel) was founded in the 18th century. Prayer services were conducted in Bergen until 1813, when the Vilbel community inaugurated a synagogue, with a mikveh in its yard, on Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”). The Vilbel Jews hired their first teacher—he also served as chazzan and shochet—in, at the latest, 1816. We also know that in 1840, prior to which local Jews used the cemetery in Bergen, the community consecrated its own burial grounds between Gronauer Weg and the general cemetery. In May 1938, the windows in a Jewish-owned home were smashed. Many Jews subsequently left Vilbel, and the community was disbanded in the summer of 1938, around which time the synagogue was sold. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior and furniture, burning (this was done outside) the Torah scrolls and ritual objects. The building, however, was spared, for it had been bought by non-Jews. Jewish homes and businesses were wrecked and looted, and Jewish men (all but the elderly) were sent to a concentration camp. Twenty-one Vilbel Jews managed to emigrate, but most of the others relocated within Germany. Eight were deported in September 1942: five to Theresienstadt and three to Poland. In February 1945, a local Jew married to a non-Jewish spouse was deported to Theresienstadt. At least eight Vilbel Jews perished in the Shoah.

Burials were conducted in Arfurt until the 1820s, when a cemetery was consecrated in Villmar. The community also maintained a charitable organization. In 1933, 35 Jews still lived in Villmar, many of whom emigrated from or relocated within Germany soon afterwards. Although the synagogue had been sold to Christian buyers before November 1938, it was nevertheless attacked on Pogrom Night; the interior was desecrated and damaged, and the ritual objects were thrown onto the street and destroyed.

Villingen’s Jews established a prayer room at 33 Gerberstrasse, the home of a local Jewish cattle trader, in the late 1880s. By the 1920s, services were held there only sporadically, but a teacher/shochet from Randegg still commuted to the town once a week. In 1933, 60 Jews lived in Villingen. Because Jews from other towns had moved to Villingen, 75 Jewish residents were registered there by year’s end. The prayer room was burned on Pogrom Night, and its owner was assaulted. Four Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Forty-two Villingen Jews emigrated, ten relocated within Germany, six died in the town and 11 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940.

Construction was completed in 1883, after which a festive inauguration took place: in attendance were state and government dignitaries, local officials and representatives of the Catholic Church. A Jewish community center was built on the same site in 1920. By the early 1930s, anti-Semitic acts were on the rise, with Nazi youth groups verbally abusing Jewish businessmen. These acts eventually escalated into physical violence and, as a result, Jews started leaving Waldenburg. By 1939, only 24 Jews still lived in the town.

Walldorf an der Werra,14th century,562 in 1849 (approximately 33% of the total population),32,"Town records from 1349 mention a Jewish presence in Walldorf an der Werra, but it was not until the 16th (possibly 17th) century that Jews resettled there in larger numbers. In 1789, three local Jewish congregations merged to form the largest Jewish community of the region (the Duchy of Saxe Meiningen). The synagogue in Walldorf on Am Tanzberg, built in 1789-1790, was renovated in 1842, 1845 and again in 1851. A school was built on the same site in 1840, and we also know that the Jewish cemetery near Solzer Strasse was in use from 1737 until 1936. In 1933, Walldorf ’s 32 Jews employed a shochet and a teacher, the latter of whom also served as a chazzan; three Jewish schoolchildren received religious instruction that year. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was vandalized, its furniture destroyed and the scrolls and prayer books were transferred to the mayor’s office. Windows in Jewish homes were smashed, Jewish women were assaulted and five men were deported to Buchenwald. The remaining Jews were deported during the years 1942 to 1944. At least 42 Walldorf Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was torn down in 1949; in 1988 two commemorative plaques were unveiled at the site.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJKT, EJL, FJG, W-G",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1318,1318
Walldorf,1470,169 in 1852,53,"Community records indicate that by 1767 Walldorf ’s Jews had established a prayer hall in a residence at 45 Hauptstrasse. Local Jews opened a synagogue (in a former Protestant church) in 1861 and a school in 1835, the latter of which closed in 1876. Burials were conducted in Wiesloch until 1880, when a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Walldorf. In 1933, five Jewish schoolchildren studied religion in the town. A chevra kadisha and a Jewish women’s association were active there. Local Jewish men were sent to Dachau on Pogrom Night, when rioters demolished the synagogue’s interior and Torah Ark, vandalized three homes and looted Jewish-owned stores. Later, the street on which the synagogue stood— Synagogenstrasse, or “synagogue street”—was renamed SA Strasse. Twenty-one Jews emigrated, 10 died in Walldorf (including three women who committed suicide, one on Pogrom Night) and 21 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 27 Walldorf Jews perished during the Shoah. The prayer room building, now a residence, bears a memorial plaque. The street name Synagogenstrasse was reinstated after the war and, in 1954, the synagogue was converted into a church; it, too, bears a memorial plaque.

Wallau,16th century,33 in 1843,23,"By 1843, most Wallau Jews were traders (of cattle and agricultural products) and peddlers. The community maintained a synagogue, a mikveh and a school, the last of which was presided over by a teacher who also served as chazzan and shochet. The earliest record of a prayer room, established in a residential building on Enggasse, is from 1701 (the ritual slaughterhouse was located on the same premises). In 1885, the building was enlarged to accommodate a Jewish community center with a school and an apartment for the teacher; in 1920, the synagogue was renovated to provide seating for 40 men and 24 women. Wallau’s Jewish cemetery (on Langenhainer Strasse) was consecrated in 1738. Local Jews were not only active in the social life of the town, but also maintained a charitable organization and a Jewish women’s association. According to records, 23 Jews still lived in Wallau in 1933, many of whom subsequently left due to economic and political persecution. As a result, the synagogue was sold at some point in the 1930s. On Pogrom Night, SA men damaged the synagogue, after which they loaded its ritual objects onto the community’s hearse, then drove to a sports field and set their loot on fire. Later, in 1942, Wallau’s nine remaining Jews were deported to the camps. At least 11 local Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1967, the synagogue was pulled down and replaced by a residential building, Today, a plaque—it was affixed to the new building—and a memorial in the cemetery commemorate Wallau’s former Jewish community.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL  www.ca-wallau.com/synagoge-wallau.htm",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1316,1316
Wallertheim,1690,68 in 1905,36,"The Jewish community of Wallertheim established a prayer hall in, at the latest, 1851. In order to accommodate the growing Jewish congregation, Wallertheim Jews inaugurated a new synagogue (at 3, Neustrasse) in 1884. Wallertheim had two Jewish cemeteries: the first, consecrated in the early 17th century, was enlarged in 1765 and closed in 1835, after which, in 1840, the community consecrated a new cemetery. We also know that local Jews maintained a mikveh and employed (until the 1930s) a teacher of religion who served as chazzan and shochet. In 1913, windows were smashed in two Jewish homes; a fence was destroyed in a third. By 1927, synagogue services were conducted only on Saturdays. Thirty-six Jews lived in Wallertheim in 1933. A chevra kadisha and a welfare association were active in the community, with which the Jews of Gau-Bickelheim (10) and Armsheim (four) were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue on fire, ransacked Jewish homes and businesses and desecrated the new cemetery; a 94-year-old Jewish man died of wounds he sustained that night. Later, in 1940, the old cemetery was leveled. Twenty-one local Jews emigrated (16 went to the United States), 15 relocated within Germany, one passed away in Wallertheim and one was killed on Pogrom Night. All Jews had left Wallertheim by 1940. At least 26 Wallertheim Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1952, the local council took over the former synagogue, after which the building was used as council offices.

Wallerstein,late 13th century,296 in 1811/12 (14% of the total population),16,"Wallerstein’s Jewish cemetery was established in or around the year 1510. The village, in which a rabbinate was headquartered from the 16th century until 1882, produced many renowned rabbis, among them Rabbi Moshe Levi Heller, referred to at the time as the “rabbi for the whole of Germany,” and his grandson, the famous Mishna commentator Rabbi Yom Tov Lippmann Heller (1579-1654). The community’s old synagogue and mikveh, located in the Judenhof (“Jews’ yard”), were demolished in 1804, after which, in 1807, a new synagogue was inaugurated in Wallerstein. Until the early 20th century, the community employed a teacher of religion who also served as chazzan and shochet. By 1933, only one child studied with a teacher who commuted to the village. Later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue was attacked, its interior and ritual objects were destroyed. Two Wallerstein Jews emigrated, four relocated within Germany and three died in Wallerstein. In 1942, the village’s remaining six Jews were deported to Piaski and to Theresienstadt. At least 11 Wallerstein Jews perished in the Shoah. A large section of the Jewish cemetery was destroyed during the Nazi period. After 1945, the former synagogue housed a cinema; and in 1979, the building was demolished, after which a bank was built on the site.

In 1859, as the village’s Jewish population started to dwindle, the community center was sold. Walsdorf’s Jews were affiliated with the Trabelsdorf community in 1907. Between the years 1826 to 1869, Walsdorf ’s Jewish children attended the school in Kolmsdorf, after which the community hired teachers from Trabelsdorf. In 1931, a teacher from Bamberg instructed the village’s Jewish pupils (those schoolteachers also performed the duties of cantor and ritual slaughterer). The cemetery was desecrated in 1933. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; ritual objects and books were set on fire. Eleven Walsdorf Jews emigrated, four relocated within Germany and one died in Walsdorf. Six Jews were deported to Izbica in April 1942; the village’s last Jewish woman was deported to Theresienstadt in September of that year, and died on the way there. At least 17 Walsdorf Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue, sold in 1940, was then used for storage purposes.

Jewish schoolchildren attended the community’s elementary school until 1870, when all confessional schools in Baden were closed, after which local Jews employed a teacher of religion who also functioned as a chazzan and shochet. By the 1920s, the community had dwindled to such an extent that regular services were no longer held in the synagogue. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned down; six Jews were brutally assaulted, and the cemetery was desecrated. Six local Jews emigrated, three relocated within Germany, five died in Wangen and seven were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least six Wangen Jews died in the Shoah.

Wannbach,1765,61 in 1880 (25% of the local population),1,"Wannbach is in Oberfranken (Upper Franconia), in an area known today as Fraenkische Schweiz. The town is now part of Pretzfeld. It is thought that Jewish families lived in Wannbach in the 17th century as “protected Jews.” The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Wannbach, a contract dated 1765, permitted three Jewish families to live next to the castle of the Count of Seinsheim. In 1770, the tiny Jewish community inaugurated a synagogue—the mikveh was located in the basement—at Haus Nr. 25 (literally “house number 25”). Although local Jews never consecrated their own cemetery (burials were conducted in Hagenbach), they did manage to establish a Jewish school in 1829. In 1910, by which time the Jews of Wannbach had not been able to gather a minyan for 10 years, the community joined that of Hagenbach, resulting in a new name for the community: the religious community of Hagenbach- Wannbach. The defunct synagogue was sold in 1900, after which it was used as a shed. In 1925, only four Jews lived in Wannbach; and in 1934 the Hagenbach-Wannbach community was dissolved. According to records, the remaining Jews moved to Bamberg. Nevertheless, on Pogrom Night, Nazis destroyed the interior of Wannbach’s former synagogue (the building was later torn down) as well as the home of Wannbach’s only remaining Jew, Ernst Wollner. Wollner was sent to the Forchheim prison and never returned. According to Yad Vashem, 15 Wannbach Jews were killed in the Shoah. As of this writing, a memorial has never been erected in the town.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, SG-H, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1323,1323

A permanent settlement was established there at the beginning of the 19th century, but it was not until October 1, 1907, that local Jews were classified as an independent Jewish community. Jews conducted services in prayer halls until June 19, 1910, when a synagogue was inaugurated at 48 Langekampstrasse (formerly Heinrichstrasse); the building also housed a Jewish elementary school (opened on April 1, 1910) and an apartment for a permanent teacher. Although the community did not have a mikveh, it did maintain its own cemetery at Eichener Bruck. In 1933, anti-Semitic violence escalated in Wanne-Eickel. The Nazis enforced the boycott of Jewish stores zealously, causing many bankruptcies. As a result, 40% of the Jewish population had left the town by the end of the year. In October 1938, the town’s Eastern European Jews were expelled to the Polish border. One month later, on Pogrom Night, the synagogue and several Jewish-owned stores were set on fire, a number of Jewish homes were destroyed and Jewish men were sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. By 1939, most Jews had left Wanne-Eickel. Beginning in 1941, the remaining Jews were deported to the camps of Eastern Europe. At least 130 local Jews were killed in the Shoah.

Warburg,1559,295 in 1909,160,"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Warburg, dated 1559, mentions two Jews who had received a writ of protection from the authorities. Warburg developed into a center of Jewish life after the mid-16th century, and the county rabbinate of Paderborn was based there from 1686 until 1814. In 1855, the Jewish community of Warburg, along with those of several surrounding towns, became an independent synagogue association. According to records, Jews made up 10% of Warburg’s total population in 1802. Local Jews conducted services in several prayer halls after 1648/49. Established at An der Burg (in the old city) in 1693, the community’s synagogue also housed a Jewish school until 1909, when the latter was moved to a separate building. Beginning in the 1680s, the community maintained a cemetery at Mollhauser Graben; a new cemetery, however, was consecrated on Am Sacktor in the 19th century. In 1933, the Nazi Propaganda Ministry shut down the Warburg’s Jewish school and implemented the anti- Jewish boycott. Many local Jews left as a result of the deteriorating economic situation; violence against Jews became common during the 1930s. Although the synagogue was not set on fire on Pogrom Night, rioters made sure to damage its interior; Jewish men were sent to Dachau and to Buchenwald that night. The Warburg authorities appropriated the synagogue after the pogrom. By 1939, approximately 91 Jews still lived in Warburg. Deportations to the Riga ghetto and to the camps of Eastern Europe began in 1941. One hundred and fortyeight local Jews were deported, of whom 136 were murdered. A memorial plaque was later affixed to one of the cemetery’s walls. Although the synagogue building survived the war, it bears not a trace of its former use.

Wassertruedingen was home to a district rabbinate during the years 1681 to 1865, and had a Talmud Torah school from 1681 (perhaps earlier) to 1904.

In 1933, two welfare organizations and a women’s association were active in the town. The community center was sold in 1938. On Pogrom Night, Nazis destroyed the synagogue’s interior and its ritual items; they tried to blow up the building, but were prevented from doing so by the inhabitants of neighboring houses. Two Jewish homes were vandalized, during the course of which one Jewish woman jumped out of a window. Six local Jews emigrated, 22 relocated within Germany and one died in Wassertruedingen.

Beginning in the 16th century, Warendorf ’s Jewish community grew steadily, with many prominent Jewish officials from Muenster, such as the district rabbi, choosing to settle in the town. In 1648, the community established a prayer room in the back building at 317 Freckenhorsterstrasse (present-day no. 7); a Jewish school was located in the front of the building until 1845. In 1808, local Jews opened a new synagogue and a new cemetery—the latter replaced the older cemetery, which had been laid in 1772—in 1808 and 1810, respectively. We also know that local a Jewish sisterhood and a Gemach (an interest-free loan fund) were active in Warendorf. On Pogrom Night, members of the SA and SS attacked Jewish homes and destroyed the interior of the synagogue. Accordingly, several Jews were hospitalized; others were arrested and later deported to Riga. Although the synagogue building was sold at some point after the pogrom, services were conducted there again on the Jewish New Year of 1945.

By 1812, Wattenheim Jews had established a prayer hall in a private residence. When, in 1849, a synagogue was built on Hauptstrasse, that private residence became a Jewish school.

Records suggest that the Jews of Wattenheim maintained a mikveh, and we know for certain that burials were conducted in the Hettenleidelheim cemetery on Schlossgasse (the cemetery was first documented in the 17th century) until 1865, when a cemetery was consecrated on Tiefenthaler Strasse in Wattenheim. In 1930, Wattenheim’s remaining Jews—the community had dwindled considerably during and after World War I— controversially donated the defunct synagogue to a local Catholic church. The Catholic congregation established a kindergarten there, but this fact (not to mention the fact that the property was no longer owned by Jews) did not prevent rioters from vandalizing the building on Pogrom Night, shortly after which the church sold the building to a local couple who, in 1939, pulled it down and planted a garden on the site.

Weilerswist,1650,54 in 1869,24,"In 1848, a Jewish community was officially founded in Weilerswist as an affiliate of the regional congregation of Euskirchen. Services were conducted in a small prayer room—the house was owned by Michael Kaufmann and Simon Carl—until 1848, when the community built a synagogue at 45 Hauptstrasse (present-day Koelner Strasse); the new synagogue seated 28 men and 18 women. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Weilerswist a few years before the synagogue was opened. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned to the ground in the presence of the fire brigade, whose members were instructed to protect the surrounding buildings from the blaze. The mob, consisting of local residents and people who came from outside the village, plundered Jewish homes and a shop owned by Willy Kain, who was detained at the police station. (Extensive documentation is available on court hearings related to thefts committed by villagers during the pogrom.) In 1939, the municipality bought the former synagogue site and sold it shortly thereafter. At least 15 Jews from Weilerswist perished in the Shoah.

Weingarten,1525,183 in 1864,60,"In 1840, the Jewish community of Weingarten replaced its dilapidated synagogue on Kirchstrasse (unknown date of construction) with a new house of worship on the corner of Kirchstrasse and Keltergasse. Weingarten’s Jewish school was closed in 1815, after which the community employed a teacher of religion who also served as a shochet and chazzan. The Jewish cemetery on Gewann Effenstiel was consecrated in 1833. In 1933, 60 Jews lived in Weingarten. Five Jewish schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from Untergrombach, and a women’s association was active in the town. The synagogue’s interior was destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were Torah scrolls, prayer books and furniture; non-Jewish teachers and local schoolchildren participated in the destruction, which included the plundering of a Jewish-owned hardware and machinery shop. The synagogue building was pulled down shortly after the pogrom. Three local Jews moved to Weingarten after 1933. Thirtytwo Jews emigrated from Germany, four moved to Karlsruhe, three died in Weingarten and 24 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 29 Weingarten Jews perished in the Shoah.

Weisenau,1444,unknown,unknown (36 in 1931),"From 1702 until 1784, Weisenau was ruled by an electoral office of the Archbishop of Mainz and by the local Immunity of the Provost of the St. Victor Monastery. This resulted in two Jewish communities, the Electoral Jews and the Immunity Jews, who were united into one community in 1784. Weisenau’s 18th-century Jewish community made up 21% of the total population of the town. The earliest record of a synagogue is dated 1722. In 1737, the Immunity Jews built a new synagogue on Wormser Strasse while the Electoral Jews established a prayer hall on land owned by the electoral office of the Archbishop of Mainz. Later, in 1760, the Immunity Jews purchased a house (it neighbored the synagogue) and established a community center and mikveh there. That synagogue’s roof was destroyed by fire in 1793, but it was not until 1818 that the community was able to repair the damage; other renovations were carried out during the 19th and 20th centuries. The synagogue closed down in July 1938. Local Jews conducted burials in Mainz until 1881, when the community consecrated its own cemetery on Portlandstrasse. Nazis looted the synagogue on Pogrom Night, soon after which, in 1939, the building was sold for much less than its true value. Altogether, eight local Jews, Weisenau’s last, were deported in 1941 and 1943. At least five Weisenau Jews perished in the Shoah. After World War II, a local resident purchased the synagogue building and converted it into a chicken coop and woodshed. The Order of St. Vincent inherited the synagogue in 1978 and donated it to the municipality of Mainz in 1985, at which point the building was listed as a historical monument; during the years 1988 to 1996, the municipality restored the building and converted it into a memorial.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, EJL, LFD-RP, S\MZG, YV  www.regionalgeschichte.net",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1337,1337
Weinheim,1228,192 in 1905,168,"Jews were persecuted in Weinheim in 1298 and during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49; in 1391, they were expelled from the Palatinate, as were all Jews in the region. It was not until the 17th century that a new Jewish community began to develop in Weinheim. The Jewish community of the Middle Ages maintained several synagogues during the 13th and 14th centuries, one of which was burned down in 1298 with 79 worshipers still inside. A new synagogue was erected on Hauptstrasse in 1690 (it was renovated and enlarged on several occasions), and we also know that another house of worship was inaugurated at 5 Ehret Strasse in 1906. Weinheim Jews were not only able to hire a teacher of religion (he served as chazzan and shochet), but also maintain a mikveh and a teacher’s seminary, the latter of which was based in Weinheim during the years 1861 to 1863. Although a Jewish cemetery was consecrated in Weinheim in 1666, it was eventually abandoned; from the 18th century onwards, burials were conducted in Hemsbach. In 1933, 22 local schoolchildren received religious instruction. Several Jewish associations and branches of national organizations were still active in the community that year. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects were demolished, after which the building was dynamited. Jewish businesses and homes were damaged, and Jewish men were sent to Dachau. In all, 102 local Jews emigrated, 25 relocated within Germany, 24 passed away in Weinheim and 47 were deported to Gurs, France, on October 22, 1940. At least 92 Weinheim Jews perished in the Shoah. Twenty-six Jewish patients from the local psychiatric hospital were also murdered. A residential building was erected on the former synagogue site after World War II.

Weissenfels an der Saale,1350 (see below),unknown,165,"Although we do not know when Jews first settled in Weissenfels, their recorded history there begins with the Black Death persecutions of 1350. The year 1386 marked a gathering of rabbis known as the “Weissenfelser Judenturnier”; the rabbis were, presumably, waylaid on their way home and held for ransom. According to a document from 1402, the Jewish community maintained a school and a synagogue, the latter of which was located at Klingenthore. Later, in 1453, Jews were expelled from Weissenfels, having been accused of forming a secret alliance with the Hussites. It was not until the mid-18th century that another Jewish presence was established in Weissenfels. The modern Weissenfels Jewish community was part of the community of Halle until 1883, when Weissenfels’ 70 Jews were recognized as an independent community with their own synagogue and cemetery (the latter was established inside the general burial grounds on Friedensstrasse). In 1932-33, the leaders of the community were Julius Lewinsohn, Siegfried Schloss and Karl Reite; community representatives were Adolf Gutmann, Walter Gottheil and someone named Hoffmann; Simon Rau served as rabbi, chazzan and teacher. A local branch of the German Zionist Organization and a cultural association were opened in Weissenfels in mid-1933 and in 1935, respectively. In October 1938, three local Jewish families were deported to Poland. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 9-10, 1938), the synagogue’s interior was destroyed; several Jews were sent to concentration camps. Forty Jews still lived in Weissenfels in May 1939; in 1941, that number was 24, of whom four were killed, three committed suicide and others were deported to the East. Of the 165 Jews who lived in Weissenfels in 1933, at least 66 perished in the Shoah. In 1945, a memorial was unveiled in honor of 229 Russian and Hungarian Jews who perished in Buchenwald and whose ashes were buried in Weissenfels’ general cemetery; the memorial also honors 24 murdered local Jews. Later, in 1987, copies were made of 58 weather-beaten Jewish tombstones. The former synagogue building, temporarily used as a residence, was later converted into a museum called the Simon Rau Center. Memorial stumbling blocks have been unveiled in Weissenfels, and there are plans for more.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJL, EJL, FJG, LJG, YV  www.stadt-hohenmoelsen.de/  www.uni-leipzig.de/  www.juedische-allgemeine",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1338,1338
Weisweiler,1546,166 in 1926,107,"The Jews of Weisweiler were affiliated with the congregation in Dueren. Synagogues were inaugurated in the village in 1760 and in 1891 respectively, the latter of which was located on Moltkestrasse, in a house belonging to the Kaufmann family. Weisweiler had a Jewish school during the years 1844 to 1861. Although the synagogue was confiscated from the Jewish community in 1935, Nazis nevertheless attacked the building on Pogrom Night (November 1938), breaking windows and destroying the furniture and ritual objects; at the marketplace, the Torah scrolls, prayer books and benches were set on fire. Jewish homes were wrecked that night, and the cemetery was desecrated. Jews who stayed in Weisweiler after the pogrom were eventually deported, prior to which they had been forced to move into a barracks. Deportation records mention the names of 52 Weisweiler Jews; Yad Vashem has details on at least nine murdered local Jews, but the actual figure is probably higher. In 1988, a memorial was unveiled next to the former synagogue site and, in 2008, commemorative stumbling stones were embedded in sidewalks throughout the town.","Swetlana Frank  Sources: FJG, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1339,1339
Wenings,17th century,126 in 1880 (13% of the total population),47,"Records from 1629 refer to the famous scholar Rabbi Juda Mehler Reutlinger, who was born in Wenings in 1609 and, later, left for Bingen. Inaugurated in 1878 as a replacement for an older synagogue (built at some point during the first half of the 1800s), the synagogue on Amtshofstrasse in Wenings accommodated approximately 100 worshipers. The Jewish community, which belonged to the Orthodox rabbinate in Giessen, maintained a Jewish school—the building housed a mikveh and was attached to the synagogue—and a cemetery. Located to the northeast of town, the Jewish cemetery was consecrated in the second half of the 19th century; prior to that, burials took place in Birstein. The community leaders in 1932 were Salamon Rosenthal III and Josef Goldschmidt. That year, Adolf Bauer of Gedern instructed six of Wenings’ Jewish schoolchildren in religion. Bernhard Prager was the chazzan/shochet. Forty-seven Jews lived in Wenings in 1933. After Pogrom Night (November 1938), however, when the interior of the synagogue was burned, all Wenings’ Jews left, with 11 apparently ending up in concentration camps. At least 19 locals Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was converted into a Catholic church in 1958. A memorial stumbling stone was later unveiled in memory of Sara Stein (born Rosenberg) of Wenings.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1340,1340
Wenkheim,1576,181 in 1880,46,"In 1840, the Jewish community of Wenkheim replaced its 17th-century prayer hall with a proper synagogue; the new building housed a mikveh, a school and an apartment for a teacher who also served as shochet and chazzan. The Jewish cemetery on Gewann Grosser Wald, which had been consecrated in, at the latest, the 17th century, served Wenkheim and the neighboring Jewish communities. In 1933, four schoolchildren studied religion in Wenkheim. Torah study groups and a charitable organization were active in the town. The synagogue’s interior and ritual objects were destroyed on Pogrom Night; Jews, however, were permitted to bury several desecrated prayer books. An attempt to dynamite the synagogue building failed, and it was subsequently used to house prisoners of war. Thirty Jews emigrated from Wenkheim before 1940; five relocated within Germany. The 11 remaining Jews were eventually moved into the Bravmann family’s home, from which they were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. At least 34 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue—it had been used as a residence and warehouse after the war— was restored in 1992.

Werl,1565,144 in 1897,41,"In Werl, most Jews earned a living as sellers of commercial mortgages, or as ritual slaughterers and livestock traders. The few who managed to become craftsmen were harassed by the guilds. It was not until the mid-19th century that an official Jewish congregation was established in Werl. Records suggest that Werl’s Jewish school, first documented in 1723, was also used as a prayer hall. The community built a new synagogue, on Baeckerstrasse, in 1811; the building was renovated in 1897, after which men and women worshiped together. We also know that one of the synagogue’s rooms served as a school until 1892, when a new Jewish school was founded nearby; as a result of low enrollment numbers, the school was closed in the 1920s. Werl was home to two Jewish cemeteries, the first of which was consecrated in the 16th century. The modern Jewish community consecrated another cemetery, on Grafenstrasse, in the 19th century. In late May 1933, rioters smashed the windows of local Jewish-owned businesses. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue was burned down, Jewish properties were vandalized and looted, and Jewish men were sent to Buchenwald. Later, in 1942, all but nine of Werl’s 37 remaining Jews were deported to Theresienstadt or to Zamosc. A memorial plaque was later unveiled at the former synagogue site.

In 1830, however, the Orthodox Jewish community of Werlau and the liberalleaning community of neighboring St. Goar beseeched the local government for permission to build a house of worship. Permission was granted, but only for one synagogue, which the two communities inaugurated in a small house in Werlau. This synagogue was used until 1888, when the Orthodox Jews of Werlau broke away from the congregation and established their own synagogue. The original house of worship, used by the liberal congregation, ceased functioning shortly after the split, but the Orthodox synagogue was used until 1930. On Pogrom Night, SA men ransacked the small Orthodox synagogue and smashed its windows; located as it was inside an apartment building, the house of worship was not set on fire.

School-age children were able, from 1808 onwards, to study religion and Hebrew in the apartment of the community’s teacher; Werne was also home to a Jewish school for several years during the 1860s. Consecrated in the 17th century and enlarged in 1780, Werne’s Jewish cemetery was built near the city hall; today, it contains 35 extant gravestones.

Wertheim’s last synagogue, built on the Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”) in 1799, was renovated several times. A mikveh was located nearby, and the community employed a teacher of religion who also functioned as a chazzan and shochet. Gumpert Thalmann, head of Baden’s Jewish Teachers’ Organization, was the Wertheim community’s teacher for 40 years (from 1886 until 1926). Wertheim’s Jewish cemetery, consecrated on Schlossberg in 1406, was the oldest Jewish cemetery in the region of Baden-Wuerttemberg. In 1933, ten Jewish schoolchildren studied religion in Wertheim.

In 1829, Wesel became an independent Jewish community. Two synagogues were established in Wesel during the 17th century: the first, of unknown location, served the regional rabbi, David Jacobs, as an office after 1640; the second synagogue, in use from 1694 onwards, was located at 1299, Rheinstrasse. In 1844, the community acquired the house on Rheinstrasse (present-day Nieder/Pastor Boelitz Strasse), after which the building served as Wesel’s main synagogue. The Jewish school, located on Feldstrasse after 1861, was moved to Willibrordiplatz in the early 20th century.

Wesermuende’s Jewish community was attached to that of Bremerhaven, the port for the ancient city of Bremen. Jews settled in Lehe in the early 19th century: a cemetery was consecrated in 1804, and the synagogue in Geestemuende, with its seating capacity of 300, classrooms and communal offices, was built in 1878. When the boroughs merged in the early 1920s (see above), the Jews of Bremerhaven became members of the new community. Many Jews flourished at the beginning of the 20th century, and some even achieved national fame in business and the professions. Prominent among these Jews was the Schocken family, founders of the renowned publishing house and the chain stores that bear their name. Displeased with the results of the anti-Jewish boycott of 1933, local anti-Semites escalated their onslaught on Jewish businesses in 1935, so that by the end of that year one-third of the Jewish community had left Wesermuende. The synagogue was set on fire on Pogrom Night; Jewish homes were wrecked and businesses, including the landmark Schocken store, were vandalized. Many Jewish men were arrested, abused and taken to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The synagogue’s ruins were demolished in 1939 at the expense of the Jewish community. By 1939, only 113 Jews, crammed into designated “Jews’ houses,” still lived in Wesermuende; in 1942, those who had not managed to escape (approximately 80) were deported and murdered.

In 1933, nine Jewish children received religious instruction. Two Jewish associations (one for men, the other for women) were active in the community, with which the Jews of Gemuenden and Willmenrod were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, the interior of the synagogue was destroyed. Later, in early 1939, the community was forced to repair the building; in March 1939, the site was sold for a mere 175 Reichsmarks. Most local Jews emigrated from or relocated within Germany. In 1941 and 1942, Westerburg’s remaining Jews were deported. At least 36 Westerburg Jews and six from Willmenrod perished in the Shoah.

The synagogue building was auctioned in 1939, soon after which, in 1940, the Jewish cemetery was closed down and desecrated. By 1941/42, 54 local Jews had emigrated; several had relocated within Germany. Twenty-eight Wetter Jews were eventually deported (via Kassel and Marburg), and at least 40 perished in the Shoah. In the year 2000, the municipality purchased the synagogue building, which was used as a barn and storage site after the war. Beautifully restored during the years 2000 to 2005, the building, now a historical monument, serves as a memorial and as a social center. In 1992, a memorial plaque was affixed to the town hall. The restored Jewish cemetery was desecrated in 1989 and again in 2008.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, FJG, SIA  www.synagoge-wetter.de/cms/geschichte/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1351,1351
Wetzlar,1277,210 in 1880,132,"Records from the years 1318, 1389, 1425 and 1535 mention various synagogues in Wetzlar. In 1756, a new synagogue was inaugurated on Pfannenstielgasse, seating 50 men and 23 women. At some point during the 16th century, the Jewish community consecrated a cemetery in Wetzlar; another cemetery was consecrated at Silhoefer Tor (near the town wall) in the 17th century, and we also know that new Jewish burial grounds were opened on Bergstrasse in 1882. In 1933, 132 Jews lived in Wetzlar. A chevra kadisha, a women’s association and two charity associations were active in the community; a teacher/chazzan instructed nine Jewish schoolchildren in religion. On Pogrom Night, rioters destroyed the synagogue’s interior, desecrated the cemetery and ransacked Jewish homes and businesses; Jewish men were arrested, after which, it is assumed, they were sent to Buchenwald. During the years 1933 to 1938, 26 local Jews emigrated, 16 relocated within Germany and four passed away. The remaining Jews were forcibly moved to a barracks on Jahnstrasse. Approximately 50 local Jews were moved to Frankfurt am Main, from where they were deported in 1942. At least 68 Wetzlar Jews perished in the Shoah. French POWs were interned in the synagogue building during the war. The synagogue was renovated soon after the war and served Jewish internees at a displaced persons camp located near Wetzlar. The camp closed in 1948, after which the synagogue was sold to a local brewery; in 1958, the building was demolished. A retirement home—the building bears a memorial plaque—was erected on the site in 2003. Earlier, in 1989, a memorial was unveiled at the Jewish cemetery.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, FJG, PK-HNF  www.exil-club.de/groups/MigrationWetzlar/juden.htm  www.ekir.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1352,1352
Weyer,unknown,(see below),25,"The Jews of Weyer, Nochern and Lierschied founded a community on or about 1800. By 1840, the community numbered four Jewish families (11 men); in 1843, the Jewish population was 29. Twenty Jews lived in Weyer in 1895, 1900 and 1905 (nine in Nochern and between one and six in Lierschied). In 1818, the community established a prayer hall in a private residence at 1 Schulstrasse. Burials were conducted in Nochern. Only three Jewish families lived in the village in 1938. On Pogrom Night, the prayer hall was destroyed, as was the house in which it had been established. Two families immigrated to the United States before the beginning of World War II. Nine local Jews were deported in 1941, among them five members of the Ackermann family who were sent to the camp in Friedrichssegen. At least seven Weyer Jews perished in the Shoah. In Friedrichssegen, a memorial commemorates the Ackermann family.

Wickrath,18th century,240 in 1885,94 (see below),"Wickrath’s Jewish population figure for 1933 includes Jews from the affiliated communities of Wickrathberg, Beckrath, Herrath and Wanlo. The Jewish community of Wickrath maintained a synagogue, a school and a cemetery, all established in the 19th century. Inaugurated in 1814, the synagogue was replaced in 1860 with a new building. Other communal organizations included a Jewish women’s association, with 30 members (established in 1880); a men’s association, which organized funerals and aid for the sick and indigent (25 members); and a society that took care of guests of the community. Few Jewish families prospered in Wickrath, and many left for Rheydt and Moenchengladbach in search of opportunities in the developing textile industry. In 1936, the Spier family, Jewish owners of a leatherrefining factory, was forced to leave Germany after being accused of tax evasion. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), rioters set the synagogue on fire and demolished Jewish homes and shops; Jewish men were deported to Dachau. The remaining Jews were forcibly moved into “Jews’ houses” in 1939, soon after which they were deported. A memorial plaque was later unveiled in Wickrath.","Swetlana Frank  Sources: FJG, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1354,1354
Wiesbaden,1330,"3,088 in 1925","2,713","In Wiesbaden, Jews first settled in 1330 or 1385 (sources provide differing information); one source also informs us that the town’s first Jew was one Kirsan (Gershon). A Jewish community was established in Wiesbaden in 1573 at the latest, and while there were several streets that were referred to as the Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”), the city never had a Jewish ghetto as such. Jews were expelled from Wiesbaden in 1626; although the ban was rescinded in 1638, it was not until the beginning of the 18th century that community life really picked up, as evidenced by the fact that in 1708, Wiesbaden became the headquarters for the district rabbinate of 20 Jewish communities in the region. As a result of the so-called Judenordnung (or “Jews’ decree”)—issued by Countess Charlotte Amalie of Nassau-Saarbruecken in 1732—Jews were prohibited from using a number of public institutions, including bathhouses. Accordingly, local Jews established their own bathhouses and other institutions, including a Jewish coffee house in 1774. The community conducted religious services at the Judenschule (“Jews’ school”) on Metzgergasse (later renamed Wagemanngasse) until 1732, at which point services were moved to the Zum Rebhuhn (later renamed Pariser Hof ) bathhouse. A small synagogue (located at 40 Webergasse) was used during the years 1820 to 1824, soon after which, in 1826, a large 200-seat synagogue was inaugurated at 43 Schwalbacher Strasse, financed by the Frankfurt branch of the Rothschild family. The rapid growth of Wiesbaden’s Jewish population necessitated the construction of yet another synagogue: inaugurated on Michelsberg in August 1896, the new, liberal-oriented house of worship—the architectural style featured Moorish and Oriental elements—accommodated 358 men, 224 women and an organ. It was in or around the year 1896, too, that the community inaugurated a smaller synagogue (at 3 Schulberg) whose premises contained a prayer room for 40 men and a library. Orthodox Jews, opposed to the reforms introduced by the congregation of the large synagogue, conducted their own services at 2a Kleine Schwalbache Strasse. Forty-one members of the Orthodox community later founded the Orthodox Altisraelitische Kultusgemeinde (Old Israelite Congregation), which inaugurated a synagogue at 33 Friedrichstrasse (236 seats for men, 100 for women). There were also a few smaller Jewish prayer halls at different locations in Wiesbaden— namely, at 6 Bluecherstrasse (today’s 10 Kleine Schwalbacher Strasse), which belonged to the Talmud Torah association; and on Geisbergstrasse (in the Bristol Hotel), which was open only for Sabbath and holiday services. There were also a number of Jewish butcheries and a few Jewish cemeteries in the city. Burials were conducted in nearby Wehen until 1747, around which time the community consecrated its own cemetery at Auf dem Kuhberg; later, in the late 19th century, a new Jewish cemetery was consecrated at Platter Strasse, where more than 1,800 burials took place before 1943. We also know that the community consecrated a smaller Jewish cemetery at Hellkundweg. Prominent Wiesbaden Jews included: members of the Tendlau rabbinic dynasty; Rabbi Dr. Abraham Geiger, one of the most influential Reform rabbis in Germany; and Dr. Paul Lazarus, who was rabbi of the city and of the district from 1918 until 1938. Wiesbaden was home to a large number of Jewish organizations, including welfare organizations, women’s organizations, a local branch of the B’nai-B’rith, a local Zionist organization, a synagogue choir and an association of Jewish World War I veterans, to name but a few. The community always saw to the religious instruction of children, and we also know that in 1936, a Jewish school was opened on the corner of Mainzer Strasse and Welfenstrasse. In 1933, the same year local Nazis enforced the boycott of Jewish-owned stores, 2,713 Jews lived in Wiesbaden. Jewish children were later expelled from German schools, as a result of which local Jews established a Jewish school (see above); there, 160 students were enrolled until, approximately, 1942. On Pogrom Night in Wiesbaden, Nazis destroyed and burned down the Michelsberg synagogue; the city’s other synagogues and prayer halls were partly demolished. According to records, SA men ravaged 80 Jewish-owned businesses that night. Two hundred and thirty Jews died during the period following the pogrom, half of whom presumably committed suicide. In 1941, approximately 300 Wiesbaden Jews were deported to the German-occupied territories in Poland. Of those 1,000 Jews who still lived in Wiesbaden in January 1942, almost all were deported to Theresienstadt that year, and almost all were killed. Wiesbaden is no longer home to a Jewish community. A bronze memorial plaque has been unveiled at the Michelsberg synagogue.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, SG-H, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1355,1355
Wieseck,17th century,82 in 1880,approximately 30,"The Jewish community of Wieseck developed in the 17th century. By 1880, most local Jews earned a living as cattle traders, butchers or merchants; later, the town was also home to Jewish physicians and lawyers. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Wieseck was the venue for a regional Jewish congress, which convened there every three years. In 1872, the Jewish community replaced its rented prayer room on Karl Brenner Strasse (formerly Alicenstrasse) with a synagogue on the same street; the synagogue building seated 50 worshipers (32 men and 18 women) and accommodated a mikveh and a school. It is not known whether the teacher also served as the shochet and chazzan. Records do tell us, however, that a Jewish youth group was active in the community. In 1933, approximately 30 Jews still lived in Wieseck, of whom about 20 emigrated from the country, mainly going to the United States and South America, during the years of oppression that followed. On Pogrom Night, rioters burned down the synagogue’s interior, ritual objects and Torah scrolls. The building survived the fire and was later remodeled as a residence. In 1942, Wieseck’s nine remaining Jews were deported to the camps of Eastern Europe. At least 15 Wieseck Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue’s new owner refused to affix a memorial plaque to the building. Accordingly, a plaque was unveiled in a public park (located in a different part of town) in 1992.","Heike Zaun Goshen  Sources: AH, AJ, EJL  www.hagalil.com/archiv/2005/05/40jahre.htm",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1356,1356

Burials took place in Laudenbach. In 1933, eight Jewish children studied religion in Wiesenfeld; a charitable association was active in the community that year. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects, including seven Torah scrolls, were destroyed. Jewish homes and businesses were ransacked, and all Jewish men were imprisoned in Karlstadt. One man was deported to Dachau, where he later died. During the Nazi period, 23 Wiesenfeld Jews emigrated, three relocated within Germany and three died in Wiesenfeld. Nineteen were deported, via Wuerzburg, to Izbica in March 1942; and six, the village’s last, were deported to Theresienstadt, also via Wuerzburg, in June and September of 1942. At least 29 Wiesenfeld Jews died in the Shoah. After the war, a farmer used the synagogue as a storage site. In 1997, four years after the Karlstadt municipality purchased and restored the building, the former synagogue reopened as a cultural center.

Later, in 1840, local Jews replaced their gender-separated prayer facilities (built in the 18th century) with a synagogue. Wiesloch’s Jewish cemetery, which was consecrated in 1661, was enlarged in 1819 and again in 1862. In 1933, eight schoolchildren studied religion in Wiesloch. A women’s association and a charity were active in the town. On Pogrom Night, rioters demolished the synagogue’s interior and set the Torah scrolls and ritual objects on fire. Jewish homes were vandalized, windows were smashed and Jewish men were sent to Dachau. Twenty-four local Jews emigrated, 20 relocated within Germany, six died in Wiesloch and 18 were deported to Gurs on October 22, 1940. Two elderly women, the town’s only remaining Jews, were deported to Theresienstadt in 1942. At least 31 Wiesloch Jews perished in the Shoah, and we also know that 12 Jewish patients at the local psychiatric institute were killed in the Nazis’ “euthanasia” program. The synagogue building was used as a garage until it was pulled down in 1957, after which residential buildings were constructed on the site.

Wildeshausen,13th century,72 in 1865,unknown,"In 1827, the Jews of Wildeshausen formed the Wildeshausen synagogue community, which intermittently included the Jews of nearby Doettlingen, Kirchatten, Huntlosen and, later, Grossenkneten. Religious services in Wildeshausen were conducted in the Heinemann family home until 1830, when the community procured a shack at 30 Huntestrasse and remodeled it as a synagogue with a prayer room, a schoolroom and an apartment for the teacher. Due to low enrollment numbers, the school was closed in 1876, after which an itinerant teacher from Delmenhorst instructed Wildeshausen’s remaining Jewish schoolchildren. Wildeshausen’s Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1707. In 1937, Jonny and Frieda de Vries were sent to a concentration camp for so-called “Rassenmischung” (literally, “race mixing”). They both perished. Although the synagogue was sold before the Pogrom Night of November 1938, members of the SA and fire department destroyed the building that night. The SA ransacked Jewish residences and the remaining Jewishowned businesses. Five Jewish men were arrested and deported to Sachsenhausen; they returned in early 1939. In 1940, the remaining 10 Jews were forced to leave town. Sent to a so-called “Jews’ house” in Bremen, most were deported to Minsk on November 18, 1942, where they were shot. Of those Jews who lived in Wildeshausen during the years 1933 and 1940, 12 perished in the Shoah; the death toll, however, rises when former residents are included—in one such family, 29 perished in the Shoah.

Wilhelmshaven,in or around the year 1870,200 in the 1920s (see below),191,"Jews moved to Wilhelmshaven, a new seaport and naval base, in or around the year 1870. By 1901, they were registered as an official Jewish community together with the Jews of neighboring Ruestringen. The community’s members included numerous merchants and butchers, three farmers, a theater director, a well-known writer and a high-ranking soldier. Burials were conducted in Jever until 1908, when the community consecrated its own cemetery in Schortens-Heidmuehle. In 1915, local Jews replaced their prayer room with a synagogue on the corner of Boersenstrasse and Parkstrasse; the building also housed a mikveh and a school, whose teacher not only performed the duties of shochet and chazzan, but also served as chaplain to Jewish sailors. The Jews of Wilhelmshaven and Ruestringen maintained a chevra kadisha, a Jewish women’s association and, later, a literary circle and a youth movement. In 1933, 191 Jews still lived in town, of whom 100 left during the years 1933 to 1938. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), Jewish shops and homes were vandalized. Jews were taken from their houses and publicly humiliated as onlookers threw stones at them. Thirty-four Jewish men were deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Members of various Nazi organizations set fire to the synagogue; the building burned down completely, after which the surrounding walls were blown up and the ritual objects were put on display in the street. A further 45 Jews were able to leave town before 1939. Wilhelmshaven’s remaining Jews were subsequently deported and murdered. At least 68 local Jews died in the Shoah.

Jews were persecuted in Windecken during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, and it was not until the 15th century that a new Jewish presence was established there. Most local Jews lived on the Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley” (in the southeast of town), a Jewish ghetto of sorts that was dissolved in the 19th century. The Jewish community inaugurated a synagogue on Judengasse (the street was renamed three times: as Synagogengasse, or “synagogue alley” in 1918; as Braugasse in 1933; and, later, as Ostheimer Strasse) in 1481, where it stayed until 1938; the building also housed a mikveh and a Jewish school. Windecken also had a Jewish cemetery, consecrated on the road that led to the town of Hanau, either in 1497 or 1505. Prominent local Jews included the Oppenheim family, members of which established an important bank in Egypt (financing the railways there). After the pogroms of 1835 and 1891, Windecken’s Jewish population began to dwindle. Nevertheless, local Jews took an active part in the town’s life, even serving on the local council. In 1933, when 44 Jews were living in Windecken, the Nazis enforced the boycott of Jewish stores. During the following years, almost all Jewish-owned stores were “aryanized,” namely, transferred to non-Jewish ownership. In 1938, only 12 Jews still lived in Windecken. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the Nazis burned down the ancient synagogue. All Jews had left the town by July 1941. According to Yad Vashem, 14 local Jews were killed in the Shoah.

Wittelshofen was declared “Judenfrei” (“free of Jews”) in January 1939. At least 24 local Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building was demolished during the winter of 1938/39. Garages and a barn were built on the site after 1945. A memorial stone was later unveiled there.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGB, EJL, PK-BAV, SIA, SZJLB",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1367,1367
Wittlich,1307,268 in 1933,,"Jews were murdered in Wittlich during the Black Death pogroms of 1349. In 1419, a Jew who had resettled there was expelled from the area, at the same time when all Jews were expelled from the Trier Archbishopric. Another Jewish presence was recorded in 1620, but it was not until 1890 that a functioning community was founded in Wittlich. Local Jews established several institutions: a cemetery in or around the year 1670; a synagogue—in a building that had once housed a church—in 1833; a mikveh at some point during the 19th century; an elementary school in 1858; and a new synagogue in 1910. In 1933, 20 Jewish children attended the school. Several Jewish associations and branches of nation-wide organizations were active in the community, with which the Jews of Osann were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, the interiors and contents of the synagogue and school were destroyed. Jewish homes were vandalized, property was destroyed and several Jews were imprisoned in the local jail. Later, in January 1939, the synagogue and school buildings were sold to the municipality. Wittlich’s remaining Jews were forcibly moved into two houses, from which the men were often taken for forced labor. The cemetery was sold to the municipality in April 1943. One hundr ed and seven Jews emigrated, 102 relocated within Germany, 19 died in Wittlich and 32 were deported to the East and to Theresienstadt in 1941/42. At least 131 Wittlich Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1977, the renovated synagogue was opened as a cultural center; a permanent exhibition, established there in 1993, commemorates the town’s former Jewish community.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, JIW, JLW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1369,1369
Witten,1815 (26 in 1828),521 in 1910,400,"In 1869, Witten and a number of smaller, affiliated Jewish communities formed an official synagogue association. The Jews of Witten, many of whom were merchants, were active in local unions and in politics. Jewish cemeteries were consecrated on Ardeyhoehe and Helenenberg in 1830 and 1860, respectively. In or around the year 1890, a new cemetery was consecrated on Am Ledderken. The community acquired a building on Weidengasse in 1860, in which it established a synagogue, a school, a nursery and an apartment for a teacher. In order to accommodate the growing Jewish population, land was later purchased for the construction of a new synagogue and other communal institutions. Although the local authorities did not allow the community to open a new synagogue, they did permit the establishment of a school, which, together with a prayer room, was opened in 1873; according to records, the municipality forced the community to move the school several years later. Finally, on September 27, 1885, a new, liberal synagogue (it had a mixed choir) was inaugurated on Breite Strasse. Earlier, in 1884, Witten’s Orthodox Jews— they maintained their own synagogue and a school—seceded from the main community. Associations for Jewish men and women were active in Witten, as were youth associations and a center for adult education. During the years 1933 to 1937, in response to the anti- Jewish boycott, many local Jews moved to larger towns and cities. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was set on fire, Jewish homes were looted and Jews were assaulted. Two hundred and fifty local Jews were later deported to the camps; few survived. In 1979, the street on which the synagogue once stood was renamed Synagogenstrasse or “synagogue street.” A commemorative plaque was unveiled there that year, and the municipality later erected memorials next to the synagogue site (in 1994) and in the Helenenberg cemetery.","Svetlana Frank  Sources: FJG, LJG, SG-NRW, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1368,1368
Witzenhausen,15th century,168 in 1861,111 or 120 (see below),"In Witzenhausen, home to an important Jewish community in Hesse, a Jewish presence was documented as early at the beginning of the 15th century. By 1620 or 1622, a synagogue had already been established there. During the years 1665 to 1772, Witzenhausen was the seat of a chief rabbinate, the first incumbent of which, Mordekhai Suesskind Rothenburg, founded the duchy’s only yeshiva. Witzenhausen’s first synagogue (location unknown) was destroyed by fire in 1809. A new synagogue was inaugurated a year later on Steinstrasse, and we also know that the community maintained a mikveh, a Jewish school and (from the 17th century onwards) a cemetery at Alte Burg. Jewish life flourished in the town, as evidenced by the large number of Jewish organizations that were active there. In January, 1933, 120 Jews lived in Witzenhausen; later that year, that number was 111. The Jewish school was shut down in 1933, the same year in which the Nazis enforced the anti-Jewish boycott. On Pogrom Night, members of the SA and SS, accompanied by local residents, burned down the synagogue building, after which they marched through town and assaulted Jews. Forty-nine Jews left Witzenhausen during the period following the pogrom, so that no Jews lived there in 1943. According to Yad Vashem, 77 local Jews were killed during the Shoah. Witzenhausen is no longer home to a Jewish community. At the former cemetery site (on present-day Faehrgasse), a memorial plaque commemorates local victims of the Shoah. In November 1985, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the former synagogue site (present-day 22 Synagogenstrasse, or “synagogue street”).","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, SG-H, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1370,1370
Woellstein,1804,70 in 1908,45,"The Jewish community of Woellstein, with which the Jews of nearby Siefersheim were affiliated, was founded in 1820. From around the year 1810 to the year 1850, religious services were conducted in a prayer hall established in a private residence at 7 Kreuznacher Strasse; in 1850 or 1855, however, the prayer hall was moved to the neighboring house (5 Kreuznacher Strasse). The Jewish community was able to employ a teacher of religion until the outbreak of WWI, after which Jewish schoolchildren studied religion with a teacher from Fuerf. Woellstein’s Jewish cemetery, consecrated in 1820, was located on Im Oelberg. After April 1933, local Jews were often arrested and sent to the Woellstein prison or to the Osthofen concentration camp. Later, on Pogrom Night or shortly afterwards, SA men destroyed the prayer hall. Thirty-five local students from the senior high school destroyed a Jewish store, a Jewish woman was assaulted and the house and property of the last Jewish family still in Siefersheim were destroyed. A few days later, on November 12, 1938, Adolf May, the Woellstein community’s shochet, was murdered by a member of the SS; his son, Albert, disappeared. Ten Jews left Woellstein after the pogrom. In September 1942, the remaining eight Jews were deported, most of them to Theresienstadt. At least 14 Woellstein Jews perished in the Shoah. In 1995, the building that used to house the second prayer hall was given the status of an historical monument.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, EJL, FGW, LFD-RP, PK-HNF, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1371,1371
Woerrstadt,14th century,118 in 1861,50,"Jews were expelled from the region in which Woerrstadt is located in 1576, and it was not until the second half of the 18th century that a new Jewish presence was established in the town. This Jewish community opened a prayer hall, located in a private residence, in 1802; in 1833, however, one year after the owner of the private residence decided to use the building for other purposes, the community purchased an apartment building on Pfarrstrasse and converted it into a synagogue. The new synagogue, inaugurated in 1835, housed a mikveh and an apartment for a teacher—the community began to employ teachers in 1825—who also served as chazzan. In 1933, a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith was active in the community. Consecrated in 1873, the Jewish cemetery was desecrated in May 1938. Later that year, one day before Pogrom Night (November 9-10, 1938), a mob broke into and destroyed Jewish-owned homes and businesses; one Jewish man was tortured. The following day, the synagogue’s interior was destroyed and set on fire, but the fire brigade and neighboring residents extinguished the blaze. In 1940, the former house of worship was sold to the municipality and converted into an apartment building. Twenty-one Woerrstadt Jews emigrated and 23 relocated within Germany. The town’s last Jew left in May 1939.

Woerlitz,1675 (five families),139 in 1857,,"In the late 17th century, the regents of the principality of Anhalt-Dessau allowed some Jews to settle there, offering them protection in return for high taxes and an oath of allegiance. Accordingly, Jews lived in Woerlitz under relatively favorable circumstances from around 1680 onwards. By the early 19th century, they numbered 130 out of a total population of 1,700. In 1787, after the old Jewish prayer hall (it was located in the vicinity of the marketplace) had become decrepit, the community built a new synagogue just outside the Woerlitz Garden; Friedrich von Erdmannsdorff designed this architectural masterpiece, which was modeled on the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli. The synagogue served the surrounding Jewish communities too, and had a ritual bath in the basement. Religious services were held there regularly until the beginning of the 20th century. By 1910, no Jews lived in Woerlitz, and the community was formally dissolved. The synagogue was taken over by the Republic of Anhalt and, in 1937, was declared a national monument. All the synagogue’s ritual articles were transferred to the synagogue in the town of Dessau, where they were destroyed on November 9, 1938 (Pogrom Night). The director of the Woerlitz Garden managed to prevent the Nazi hordes from torching the Woerlitz synagogue during the pogrom, but the mayor of Woerlitz nevertheless had the interior of the building wrecked, leaving its exterior intact.","Fred Gottlieb  Sources: EJL, FJG, LJG, SSA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1372,1372
Woerth am Ma,18th century,26 in 1837,18,"The Jewish community of Woerth built a synagogue at 2 Hintergasse in 1889. During the early 20th century, Jewish schoolchildren from Woerth, Klingenberg am Main and Hofstetten studied religion in Klingenberg. The Woerth community buried its dead in Reistenhausen, in a cemetery belonging to the Jewish community of Fechenbach. Two Jewish children studied religion with a teacher from Mellrichstadt in 1933. In 1935, members of the Hitler Youth covered the town’s Jewish homes with tar. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night, as were its contents and ritual objects. Jewish residents were abused, and their houses were ransacked and looted. In February 1939, windows were smashed in the homes of the three remaining Jewish families. During the Nazi period, six Woerth Jews left the country (five immigrated to the United States), nine relocated within Germany and one died in Woerth. An 83-year-old Jewish woman was deported to Theresienstadt in September 1942. Another Jewish woman, who was married to a Christian, remained in the town. At least four Jews originally from Woerth perished in the Shoah. The synagogue’s ruins were later cleared.

It was not until the 18th century, however, that another Jewish family came to live in the town. Always small, the Jewish community of Wolbeck was affiliated with that of Muenster. Religious services were conducted in Israel David’s apartment until the 1820s, when the community built a new synagogue on Wallstrasse. Wolbeck also had a Jewish elementary school during that period. On Pogrom Night, rioters set the synagogue on fire and destroyed the Jewish cemetery. Nine local Jews managed to escape Germany during the Nazi period (eight went to the Netherlands, one to France); six moved to other German cities. In 1941/42, twelve Wolbeck Jews were sent to various camps, an ordeal from which only one, Helmut Pins, returned in 1945.

Wolfhagen,Middle Ages,,,"Records do not tell us when Jews first settled in Wolfhagen, but we do know that in 1235, 18 local Jews were murdered in a pogrom. The Jewish community, established in the 18th century and affiliated with the rabbinate in Kassel, numbered 59 members in 1788. In 1777, the community established a synagogue—the building also housed a school—on Schuetzenberger Strasse. Later, in 1859, a new synagogue and school were built on Mittelstrasse and Gerichtsstrasse, respectively; the school housed a mikveh and an apartment for the teacher. (The old synagogue building was later torn down.) We also know that burials were conducted in a cemetery on Auf der Liemecke (the oldest gravestone there is dated 1712) until the 1820s, after which, in 1834, a new cemetery was consecrated on Wilhelmstrasse. In 1933, approximately 70 Jews lived in Wolfhagen (65 in 1934). A teacher instructed 10 Jewish schoolchildren in religion, and four Jewish welfare organizations were active in the community: an association for young men, the Chevre Bachurim (established in 1811), the Chevre Hochnosas Kalloh which helped brides arrange and finance their weddings (founded in 1855), the Chevre Haschlischi (literally, the “third association”, established in 1833) and the Chewras Noschim, or women’s association. In January 1934, the Nazis closed down the Jewish elementary school. On Pogrom Night, SA troops from Arolsen and local residents set the synagogue on fire, looted Jewish homes and desecrated the cemetery. By November 1939, approximately 55 local Jews had relocated within Germany; ten or 11 Jews had immigrated to Paraguay, the Netherlands or Palestine. Three Jewish residents passed away in Wolfhagen.

Wolfenbuettel,1697,302 in 1910,112,"From 1781 until 1893, Wolfenbuettel was home to an 80- seat synagogue at 12 Harzstrasse. The synagogue had been founded by Samuel Gumpel, who in 1786 opened a free Talmud Torah school (later known as the “Samsonschule” or “Samson School”) for Jewish children from poor families. Enlarged in 1843 and then renamed the Samson School for Higher Level Studies, the renowned institution closed down in 1928, but not before it had produced 700 graduates, including Leo Zunz and Emile Berliner. In 1893, Wolfenbuettel’s Jewish community, which belonged to the Braunschweig rabbinate, inaugurated a larger synagogue on Lessingstrasse. The following Jewish organizations were active in Wolfenbuettel in 1933: a sisterhood, a chevra kadisha, a welfare organization, a branch of the German Zionist organization and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith. During the years 1933 to 1939, more than half the Jewish population left Wolfenbuettel.

Wollenberg,in or around the year 1660,156 in 1841 (36.6% of the total population),21,"In Wollenberg, Jews initially lived in a designated “Jews’ house” (“Judenhaus”), first documented in 1667. In 1790, a new building was erected in Wollenberg; it accommodated 13 residential units, a synagogue, a butcher’s shop, a bakery, a mikveh and a small stable for cattle. Another Jewish apartment building was erected nearby in 1795; it housed six families. By 1727, a prayer hall had been opened in the Judenhaus; the apartment building erected in 1790 also housed one. In order to accommodate the growing Jewish community, a new synagogue—the building contained a school and an apartment for the teacher—was built on Deinhardstrasse in 1825. Wollenberg Jews were able to hire teachers, all of whom served as cantors and ritual slaughterers, until the outbreak of World War I. Burials were conducted in Waibstadt. From the 1920s onwards, the community limited synagogue services to Saturdays and holidays, as too few Jews lived in Wollenberg to warrant regular services. In 1933, 21 Jews lived in Wollenberg; one schoolchild received religious instruction. The synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night, after which the remaining Jews were not only forced to transfer ownership of the site, free of charge, to the town authorities, but also to pay for the removal of the rubble. Three local Jews emigrated, nine relocated within Germany and two died in Wollenberg. On October 22, 1940, the remaining 11 Jews were deported to the concentration camp in Gurs, France.

Worms,unknown,unknown,"1,016","The Jewish community of Worms was one of Ashkenaz Jewry’s most prominent. Rashi, the Bible and Talmud commentator, and Rabbi Eliezer ha-Roke’ach were among the many celebrated rabbis and scholars of the town. The early Jewish community maintained a synagogue (built in 1034), a renowned yeshiva and the Heilige Sand (Holy Sand) cemetery, which was the oldest Jewish cemetery in Europe and the resting place of several leaders and sages of Ashkenaz Jewry, including the Maharam of Rothenburg and the Maharil. Worms’ medieval Jewish community, however, was destroyed on several occasions; the Crusader massacre of 1096 is still commemorated in Jewish elegies. In 1150, the rabbinates of Speyer, Worms and Mainz (referred to by the acronym SHUM) were empowered to serve as a high court for the Jews of Germany. The community’s 16th-century rabbis were appointed as chief rabbis of the Holy Roman Empire. Later, in 1614 and again in 1615, Jews were expelled from Worms for short periods. The aforementioned synagogue, which had been destroyed and rebuilt on several occasions, underwent extensive renovations during the years 1616 to 1624, during which time a women’s gallery and the “Rashi Chapel” were added to the structure. (The latter served as a yeshiva until 1760.) In the 18th century, Worms was home to a private synagogue whose owners, the Sinsheimer family, hired a series of rabbis. The community’s synagogue was renovated in 1842, after which, in 1868 and 1875, respectively, the congregation was introduced to the use of a harmonium and an organ during synagogue services. Accordingly, the community’s Orthodox members decided to establish their own prayer halls and, in 1875, a second synagogue—an organ was not used there—was built in Worms. Eastern European Jews prayed in their own Orthodox prayer hall, and services were also conducted at the old-age home, whose building, referred to as the Tanzhaus (“dance house”), had once housed a yeshiva. During the years 1849 to 1852, a Jew, Friedrich Eberstadt, served as mayor of Worms, a rare achievement for a Jew in 19th-century Germany. The old cemetery was closed in 1911 and declared a historical monument, as was the Rashi Chapel, which had been renovated in the mid-19th century and preserved. The new cemetery, opened in 1911, was built in Hochheim, next to the general burial grounds. In 1912, a Jewish museum was opened in Worms. Dr. Isaak Holzer was the community’s rabbi in 1933. Holzer emigrated in 1935, after which the rabbi was Manfred Rosenberg and, after 1937, Rabbi Helmut Frank. In 1935, a regional Jewish school was opened in Worms. On Pogrom Night, the synagogue was burned to the ground, as was the Rashi Chapel. The interior of the second synagogue was destroyed, and so were most of the objects in the Jewish museum. Jewish homes and businesses were wrecked, Jews were severely beaten—some were hospitalized—and 46 men were sent to Buchenwald. In 1941/42, the remaining Jews were forcibly moved into a few houses, from which the men were taken for forced labor. From 1942 until 1945, 186 Jews were deported to the East. At least 435 Jews from Worms perished in the Shoah. The old synagogue was rebuilt and rededicated in 1961; several Jewish-owned homes have been restored.

Services were conducted in private residences until 1821, when the community built its first synagogue. The new house of worship was soon unable to accommodate the growing congregation, as a result of which the community built a new synagogue towards the end of the 19th century. Local Nazis burned down the synagogue on Pogrom Night. Many Jewish men were arrested that night, and while this triggered a subsequent wave of emigration, approximately 60 Jews still lived in Wriezen during the early 1940s. They were deported in 1941/42.

Wuerzburg,1103,"2,567 in 1900","2,145","The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Wuerzburg is dated 1103. Jews were subjected to violent persecutions and expulsions throughout the Middle Ages, and it was not until the early 19th century that the Jewish population began to grow significantly. The official Jewish community of Wuerzburg was founded in 1822. Wuerzburg, a center of Jewish scholarship in the 12th and 13th centuries, was home to a renowned yeshiva and to some of the most influential Ashkenaz rabbis of the period: Eliezer ben Nathan (Ra’aven), Eliezer ben Yoel HaLevi (Ra’avyah), the Maharam of Rotenburg and several leading Tosafists lived in Wuerzburg. The city’s reputation as a center of Jewish learning diminished after the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298, after which a yeshiva of lesser importance was established there; this yeshiva was destroyed in 1349. Records indicate that a Jewish cemetery existed in Wuerzburg in the early 12th century. A new regional cemetery was consecrated in 1147, but was destroyed and cleared in the 14th or 15th century. After 1817, the Bavarian state rabbinate, headed by Rabbi Abraham Bing—a distinguished scholar who presided over a yeshiva attended by many renowned rabbis—was based in Wuerzburg. A district rabbinate was established in the city in 1839 and, in 1840, Rabbi Bing was replaced by Seligmann Baer Bamberger, known as the “Wuerzburger Rav” (the rabbi of Wuerzburg). A medieval synagogue—first documented in 1170— was confiscated in 1349. The modern Jewish community conducted services in several prayer rooms until 1842, when a proper synagogue was inaugurated in Wuerzburg. A smaller synagogue for use on weekdays was inaugurated in 1924; in 1926, the community’s Eastern European Jews began to conduct their services there. Local Jews established a Jewish school in 1856, a mikveh (of unknown date of construction), a seminary for Jewish teachers in 1864, a cemetery in 1882 and a hospital in 1885. In 1933, 2,145 Jews lived in Wuerzburg. Siegmund- Shimon Hanover was rabbi. The Jewish school had 143 students, and the teacher’s seminary 100. Many Jewish associations, as well as branches of nation-wide Jewish organizations, were active in the community that year. The Nazi campaign to destroy Jewish community life came to a head in Wuerzburg, as it did all over Germany, on Pogrom Night. That evening, approximately 1,000 SA men, operating in small groups, attacked the city’s Jewish homes and businesses, destroyed their contents, and looted valuables. A Jewish man was beaten so severely that he died of his injuries, and another Jew committed suicide. The interiors of both synagogues and of the school building were destroyed, as were the ritual objects found there; the broken furniture from the main synagogue was set on fire. Students at the seminary were abused, and the building’s furniture, windows and doors were broken. Older students and Jewish men were imprisoned together with Jews from nearby communities. After the pogrom, transports to Buchenwald included 130 Jewish men from Wuerzburg, one of whom died in the camp; another 160 Wuerzburg Jews were deported to Dachau. Although the synagogue, school and community hall were confiscated, services continued in the synagogue attached to the seminary. Many Jews moved to Wuerzburg after 1933. In total 1,649 Wuerzburg Jews emigrated, 667 relocated within Germany and 185 died in the city. In early 1942, the remaining Jews— they were often used for forced labor—were moved into a few allocated buildings, after which they were moved to the cemetery building and to the Jewish hospital. Deportations from Wuerzburg began in November 1941. In six transports, the last of which took place in June 1943, 702 Wuerzburg Jews and 1,494 Jews from the surrounding area were deported to Riga, Izbica, Theresienstadt or Auschwitz. The Wuerzburg Jewish community was officially dissolved in September 1942. At least 999 Wuerzburg Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue was destroyed during an aerial bombing in March 1945. The new Jewish community of Wuerzburg, established later that year, inaugurated a new synagogue in 1970. The cemetery was renovated, and several memorial plaques were unveiled in the city.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, DWG, PK-BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1382,1382
Wuestensachsen,1630,137 in 1871 (13% of the total population),,"The Jewish community of Wuestensachsen, with which the Jews of nearby Melperts were affiliated, was the largest community in the Gersfeld area. Religious services were initially conducted in a dilapidated building (first documented in 1865); later, apparently during the 1870s, a new synagogue was built on Hauptstrasse (presentday Rhoenstrasse). Wuestensachsen’s Jewish elementary school, established in 1894 and for which a new building was built during the years 1899 to 1903, was presided over by a teacher who also performed the duties of chazzan and shochet. Local Jews were able to maintain their own mikveh, but conducted burials in Weyhers. A chevra kadisha, a charity, a women’s association and youth groups were still active in the community in 1933. The school closed down in 1938, after which its four remaining students studied in Fulda. On Pogrom Night, SA troops burned down the synagogue after ransacking the building. At least 22 Jews emigrated (17 to the United States), 32 resettled elsewhere in Germany, 22 left for unknown destinations and one passed away in Wuestensachsen. We also know that the remaining Jews left the town in January 1939. At least 48 Wuestensachsen Jews perished in the Shoah. The schoolhouse, which accommodated a public library and the mayor’s office after 1941, was converted into a residence in 1985.

Wuppertal-Barmen,1812,721 in 1925,720 (see below),"The earliest record of a Jewish presence in Barmen is dated 1812. In 1852, the Jewish community of Barmen merged with that of Elberfeld, only to separate from it and form the independent community of Barmen in 1894 or 1895. Local Jews attended synagogue services in Elberfeld until 1895/96, when a synagogue was built in Barmen at 18 Scheurenstrasse (present-day Zur Scheuren); Ludwig Levy, the renowned Jewish architect, designed the building. A rabbi served the community, and the town had a Jewish cemetery. Several Jewish organizations were active in Barmen, most notably the Israelitische Frauenverein (Jewish women’s association) and a number of sports clubs. Barmen became part of the city of Wuppertal in 1929. Seven hundred and twenty Jews lived in Barmen in 1933. By 1933, the Wuppertal-Barmen Jewish community had merged with Wuppertal-Elberfeld, with a combined Jewish population of approximately 3,000 (6% of the general population). In March of that year, the SA arrested a local Jew, after which he was severely beaten and thrown into the river (he drowned). Nearly all Jewish-owned stores were boycotted during the years that followed. At the end of October 1938, the town’s Eastern European Jews were expelled to the Polish border. On Pogrom Night, rioters incinerated the synagogue building; the fire department protected the adjacent buildings from the blaze. Several Jewish men were arrested that night and were sent to Dachau concentration camp. Confined to five designated “Jews’ houses” after the outbreak of World War II, local Jews were deported, together with the Jews of Elberfeld, in 1941 and the subsequent years. Of the 1,000 deported Jews (from both Barmen and Elberfeld) only 150 returned. A memorial plaque was later unveiled at the former synagogue site in Barmen. The city of Wuppertal is home to a small Jewish community.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1385,1385
Wunstorf,,,,"Three Jews lived in Wunstorf in 1700, after which the town’s Jewish population grew steadily. The community maintained two cemeteries—on Hohen Holz before 1690 and, after 1830, on Nordrehr—as well as a school and a synagogue on Nordstrasse, the last of which was replaced in 1913 by a new house of worship on Kuesterstrasse, whose premises contained a mikveh, a school and a teacher’s apartment. In 1933, six Jewish schoolchildren studied religion under the guidance of a teacher/chazzan. A women’s welfare association (established in 1849) and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith (established in 1920) were active in Wunstorf. On Pogrom Night, SA troops vandalized shops and homes, destroyed the synagogue’s interior, burned its books and desecrated the new cemetery. A Jew was humiliated in public; another was beaten up. All Jews were forced to spend the night in the basement of the city hall, and some were abused. We also know that eight Wunstorf Jews were sent, via Hanover, to Buchenwald, from where seven returned in 1938/39. In total, 27 Jews left the town during the years 1933 to 1939. In 1941, all patients at the local psychiatric hospital (including Jews) were deported to Brandenburg; in 1941/42, Wunstorf ’s remaining Jewish residents were deported, via Ahlem, to the East. At least 41 Wunstorf Jews perished in the Shoah. Renovated by Jewish soldiers from the British army after the war, the synagogue was sold in 1955. Today, the structure serves as an apartment building, to which a plaque was affixed in 1988. In 2002, a memorial was erected near Marktkirche.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: EJL, FJG, GELKB, HU, JGNB1, JSN, SIA  de.indymedia.org/2008/11/232076.shtml",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1384,1384
Wuppertal-Elberfeld,1694,"2,335 in 1925","2,471 or 3,000","Wuppertal’s first known Jew, Issac Meyer, is mentioned in records from 1694, but the guilds prevented Jews from residing there permanently until 1806, when the French conquered the area and introduced new citizens’ rights, which also applied to Jews. The Jewish community in the town of Elberfeld merged with that in the town of Barmen (both towns were near Wuppertal) in 1847, separated from it 50 years later and merged with it yet again in 1929, when the towns of Elberfeld and Barmen were incorporated into the city of Wuppertal. Prominent local Jews included the following: renowned poet and essayist Else Schueler (later Else Laske-Schueler); Leonard Tietz, owner of the Kaufhof department store chain; and Zionist intellectual Moses Hess (1812-1875). In 1903, a Jew—his name is unknown—was elected to the municipal council for the first time. The Jews of Elberfeld used prayer halls in private residences until Rabbi Levy Kleelberg inaugurated a new liberal synagogue on Genuegsamkeitsstrasse. In the early 20th century, Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe settled in the town, forming their own congregations with prayer rooms on Hochstrasse and, later, on Luisenstrasse: the Ahdut congregation was formed in 1906, the Mahzikei ha-Dat congregation in 1913. Rabbi Moses Findling led the Orthodox community, which, from the 1920s onwards, maintained its own school. Elberfeld had three Jewish cemeteries: at Engelnberg an der Weissenburgstrasse after 1810, at an unknown location after 1867 and on Weinberg after 1895. Various Jewish organizations were active in the community, notably the Zionist Herzel Association, founded by Rabbi Dr. Alfred Philippe in 1904. In June 1933, approximately either 2,471 or 3,000 Jews were members of the community (sources provide differing information). As mentioned above, the Jewish communities of Wuppertal-Elberfeld and Wuppertal-Barmen merged in 1929; accordingly, the population figure for 1933 applies to the merged Jewish community. The boycott of Jewish businesses was enforced in April 1933, and by October 1938, 100 Jewish businesses had been “aryanized” and 200 Eastern European Jews had been deported to Poland. On Pogrom Night, rioters vandalized the Orthodox synagogue and incinerated the liberal synagogue and funeral parlor. One hundred and twenty-five Jews were taken into “protective custody”; for the men, this meant deportation to Dachau. In 1939, approximately 1,000 Jews still lived in Wuppertal- Elberfeld. Of these, 776 were deported after 1941; the rest were trapped in Nazi-occupied Europe after leaving the town. At least 1,000 Jews from Wuppertal-Elberfeld were deported during the Shoah; only 150 returned. After the war, a new Jewish community was established in Wuppertal. A memorial plaque now stands next to the former synagogue and Jewish cemetery. The Else Laske- Schueler Literary Foundation is based in the town.","Benjamin Rosendahl  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1386,1386
Xanten,11th century,98 in 1843,unknown (14 in 1930),"It is likely that Jews lived in Xanthen during the period of the Roman Empire, but it was only in the 11th century that their presence was recorded there. Although those Jews enjoyed the patronage of the Archbishop of Cologne (a city they had fled during the Crusades), they were massacred in Xanthen during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49. It was not until the 17th century that another Jewish community was founded in Xanthen; the new community was affiliated with the Jewish congregation in Geldern. Local Jews established a prayer hall (on Schanstrasse) in the 1780s. From the late 18th century onwards, burials were conducted at the Jewish cemetery in Heesberg, where today the surviving gravestones are arranged in three circles. In 1891, after a Christian child was found murdered, a Jewish man named Adolf Wolff Buschof and his family were arrested on charges of ritual murder. Although all the charges against Buschof were dismissed in 1892, the ensuing anti- Semitic agitation drove out many local Jews. On Pogrom Night (November 1938) in Xanten, rioters desecrated the Jewish cemetery and damaged the synagogue and Jewish homes. In 1945, the synagogue was destroyed during a bombing raid. According to records, approximately 30 local Jews were murdered in the camps. In 1988, two plaques were unveiled in Xanthen—one at the cemetery, the other at the former synagogue site. In 2007, memorial stumbling stones were unveiled next to several former Jewish homes.","Swetlana Frank  Sources: FJG, LJG, SG-NRW",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1387,1387
Zeckendorf,15th century,166 in 1837 (58.2% of the total population),22,"Zeckendorf’s Jewish cemetery, initially shared with the Jews of Bamberg, was consecrated in the 16th century; in 1784, the Jews of Demmelsdorf and of other nearby communities started conducting burials in the Zeckendorf cemetery. In 1658, four years after the Jewish community of Zeckendorf was founded, the village became the location of the headquarters of the state rabbinate of Bamberg. Zeckendorf’s 17th-century Jewish community maintained a synagogue (built in 1660), a Jewish school and a mikveh. Two more synagogues were later established in Zeckendorf: one in 1727 (it later burned down) and another in 1743. Five Jewish children studied religion in Zeckendorf with a teacher from Demmelsdorf in 1933. In 1936, 25 of the synagogue’s windows were smashed; the Jewish cemetery was desecrated in 1937 and again in 1940. On Pogrom Night, SS and SA men destroyed the synagogue’s interior and burned its ritual objects; approximately 100 local residents watched the destruction and threw stones through the windows. One Jewish man was deported to Dachau that night. In the fall of 1939, the synagogue was demolished, after which a vegetable garden was planted on the site. In April 1942, the village’s remaining 18 Jews were deported, via Bamberg, to Izbica. At least 23 Zeckendorf Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial monument was unveiled at the cemetery in 1991, four years after which the cemetery was desecrated again.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-BAV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1388,1388
Zeitz,14th century,approximately 150 in 1913,47,"The earliest records pertaining to the settlement of Jewish merchants in Zeitz are from the 14th century. Zeitz was home to 44 Jews in 1895 and to 150 (the peak population figure) in 1913. During the 15th century—Jewish families then lived on the Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley”—the community maintained a prayer room. Jews were expelled from Zeitz at the end of that century. The modern Jewish community emerged in the second half of the 19th century. Communal institutions included a prayer room, set up in the rear of the building at 8 Judengasse, and a classroom. Burials were conducted at the Jewish cemetery in Leipzig. In 1933, 47 Jews lived in Zeitz. The nation-wide, anti- Jewish boycott of April 1933 was also implemented in Zeitz, financially crippling approximately 15 Jewish-owned businesses. On Pogrom Night, SA troops destroyed the interior of the synagogue and vandalized Jewish-owned shops. Two Jews were arrested that night. Little else, however, is known about the fate of the 20 or so Jews who were still living in Zeitz at the time of the pogrom. In May 2007, memorial stumbling stones were unveiled in Zeitz. A memorial plaque has been affixed to the building that once housed the prayer room.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: LJG, SIA, W-G  juden-in-sachsen.de/  www.stolpersteine.com/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1389,1389
Zerbst,14th century (first half),122 in 1833,90-120 (see below),"The earliest record of Jewish life in Zerbst is from the first half of the 14th century, when there was already talk of a “Judenwinkel” (“Jews’ corner”) and a “Judenkever” (“Jews’ graveyard”). Fifteenth-century records make the occasional reference to the Jews of Zerbst, but it was only in the 17th century that a lasting Jewish presence was established there. The Jewish community established a cemetery during the second half of the 18th century and a synagogue in 1794. In 1905, after receiving funds from the Dessau Cohn-Oppenheim Foundation, the community replaced its tumble-down synagogue with a new house of worship at 40 Bruederstrasse; the synagogue did not have an organ, and women sat in an elevated section. Between 90 and 120 Jews lived in Zerbst in 1933 (sources provide differing information). We know for certain that the leader of the community in 1932/33 was Martin Leiser, the treasurer was Eugen Borinski, the recording secretary was Ferdinand Nussbaum and the cantor was Leopold Spier. The community maintained a chevra kadisha and a Jewish literature foundation whose presidents were Martin Leiser and Dr. Preiss. Twenty-seven Jewish children received religious instruction that year. The synagogue was not set on fire on Pogrom Night because of its proximity to other buildings. Instead, rioters smashed its windows and wrecked its interior and ritual objects; the adjacent community center, too, was ransacked. (It is said that cantor Leopold Spier, who perished in Theresienstadt in late 1942, gathered the surviving scraps of the Torah scrolls and buried them according to Jewish rites.) Jewish-owned homes and business were destroyed on Pogrom Night, after which Jews were housed in the community center until their deportation. The former synagogue building, which was remodeled and used by the German Red Cross, was destroyed during a wartime bombing raid. In 1993, a memorial plaque was affixed to the residential building that now stands on the former synagogue site; and in 2009/10, memorial stumbling blocks were unveiled in memory of the 53 Zerbst Jews who perished in the Shoah.","Esther Sarah Evans  Sources: AH, EJL, FJG  www.mendelssohn-dessau.de/  www.albert-schweitzer-sachsen-anhalt.de/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1391,1391

Other available Jewish population figures for Zell are 37 in 1822, 33 in 1925 and 70 in 1930. By 1942, all Jews had left Zell. In 1850, the community established a small prayer hall in a section of an old, local castle. Later, as more Jews settled in Zell, the community decided to build a new synagogue; construction was halted with the outbreak of World War I, and the partially completed structure was auctioned off; the money used to renovate the original synagogue. The Jews of Zell also maintained a cemetery, a ritual bath and a school for religious studies, whose teacher served as the chazzan and shochet. The interior of the synagogue was destroyed on Pogrom Night (November 1938), but its exterior was not torched for fear of damaging the castle. The Jewish community was dissolved in 1939. Those who did not manage to escape Germany perished in the Shoah. Restoration of the synagogue building was completed in 2003; the site now serves as a memorial.","Fred Gottlieb  Sources: EJL, LJG, SG-RPS",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1390,1390
Zeven,1823,22 in 1933,,"The Jewish community of Zeven, founded in 1842, included the Jews of nearby Rhade, Selsingen and Sittensen. Too small to develop communal institutions—just to hold a prayer service, every Jewish man in the village, only 10 of whom were older than 13, had to attend—the community was often challenged by the district authorities over its independent status. In 1858, after failing to establish (on the orders of the district rabbinate) a Jewish school, Zeven’s Jews were affiliated with the community in Bremervoerde. Zeven’s tiny community continued, however, to maintain a Jewish cemetery on Kleine Ahe. In 1933, a prayer room was established in a private house in Zeven; from 1936 onwards, Bremervoerde Jews, who had been forced to sell their own prayer room, conducted services there. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), all Zeven’s Jews were dragged from their beds and detained in the prayer room building. The prayer room’s silver objects were stolen, its other contents were taken to the market square and burned, and the Jewish men were later sent to Sachsenhausen. Zeven’s Jewish cemetery was desecrated after the pogrom. Two Jewish families from Zeven emigrated from Germany. In 1941, 19 Jews were deported from the village, most of them to Minsk.

It was not until the 17th century that a considerable Jewish presence was established in Ziegenhain. The community, which belonged to the provincial rabbinate in Marburg, conducted services in prayer rooms until 1853, when a synagogue and mikveh were inaugurated on Obergasse (present-day 28 Kasseler Strasse); construction plans had been drawn up in 1840, but it was not until 1852 that the synagogue was built. A school for religious studies was established in the synagogue in 1870, and we also know that the community maintained a cemetery in Niedergrenzebach and, until 1927, a Jewish elementary school. Fifty-three Jews lived in Ziegenhain in 1933, soon after which most of them left town. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), the interior of the synagogue was vandalized and plundered; one of the three Torah scrolls was later found by a local minister (he would eventually give the scroll to a Jewish displaced person after the war). Ziegenhain’s two remaining Jewish families were abused on Pogrom Night.

In 1898/99, the dilapidated building was replaced by a new synagogue on Mittelstrasse; renovated in 1930, that building housed a mikveh and a schoolroom. Burials were conducted in Meimbressen until 1846, when the community consecrated a cemetery on Ehlener Strasse. We also know the Zierenberg community ran a Jewish elementary school from 1837 until 1922; both Jacob Gutkind and Siegmund Rosenmund served as teacher, shochet and chazzan for over 40 years. In 1933, 53 Jews lived in Zierenberg, a Nazi Party stronghold. Two Jewish welfare associations—one for men, the other for women—were active in the community, and a teacher from Meimbressen instructed eight Jewish schoolchildren in religion. On the night between November 8 and 9, 1939 (namely, the night before Pogrom Night) SA and SS troops destroyed the synagogue, assaulted Jewish residents, vandalized Jewish homes and desecrated the cemetery. In 1939, Zierenberg’s mayor purchased a section of the leveled cemetery. By 1938/39, at least 28 Jews had left Zierenberg; three emigrated from the country and others relocated within Germany. At least 27 Zierenberg Jews perished in the Shoah. A memorial stone was unveiled at the former Jewish cemetery in 1946.

Zimmersrode,16th century,67 in 1905 (10% of the total population),39,"The history of Jewish Zimmersrode dates back to the 16th century. The Jews of nearby Waltersbrueck were affiliated with Zimmersrode’s modern Jewish community, which peaked in 1905 at 67 (10 % of the total population). Earlier, in 1850, Zimmersrode Jews built a schoolroom onto the synagogue on Bornstrasse (formerly called the Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley”). The head of the community in 1932 was Max Rothschild, the treasurer Sally Abraham. Levi Katz of Borken instructed eight children in Zimmersrode in religion in 1931 to 1932, and a Jewish sisterhood and brotherhood, both of which carried out welfare activities, were active in the community: the sisterhood was led by Daniel Stern’s wife, the brotherhood by Max Rothschild. Thirty-nine Jews lived in Zimmersrode in 1933. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), while local Jews hid in the home of a notary, the synagogue was destroyed; Jewish property was ransacked by locals that night.

Zirndorf,1551,105 in 1809,64,"During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Jewish community of Zirndorf maintained a yeshiva in the house of a wealthy local Jew. Zirndorf Jews prayed in a synagogue on Kleinstrasse—established in 1685—until 1768, when they inaugurated a new synagogue (renovated in 1909 and again in 1929) whose ritual items included a Memorbuch (memorial book) and a Torah scroll from 1757; the building also housed a mikveh, a school and an apartment for a teacher who served as shochet and chazzan. Burials took place in Fuerth. In 1933, a Jewish women’s association was active in Zirndorf. On Pogrom Night (November 9-10, 1938), the synagogue’s interior and ritual objects were destroyed (the memorial book survived). The following day, November 11, the remaining Jews were loaded onto a truck and driven out of town. They returned, but were ordered to liquidate their businesses and leave immediately.

No Jews lived in Zittau during the 350 years that followed. In 1885, however, Jews from Zittau and from nearby Loeban founded a joint community. The community consecrated a cemetery (on Goerlitzer Strasse) in the 1880s and a synagogue (at 12 Lessingstrasse) in 1906. Most local Jews were merchants or clothing manufacturers; records also tell us that a large local mill was owned by Jews. In 1900, a relief organization was set up in Zittau to provide support to the town’s Eastern European Jews. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), Nazis blew up the synagogue and the cemetery hall. Windows in Jewish-owned shops were smashed, eight Jewish men were arrested and 22 non-German citizens were deported to Poland. Twenty-four Jews lived in Zittau in 1941, and it is assumed that all were deported to the East. We know for certain, however, that at least 12 Zittau Jews perished in the Shoah.

A men’s association, a women’s group, a social club and a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith were active in the community, with which the Jews of Niederauerbach were affiliated. On Pogrom Night, SS men set the synagogue on fire; two Jewish-owned stores were destroyed, and 20 Jewish men were arrested. The synagogue’s ruins were demolished in 1939, after which the land was appropriated by the treasury office. Thirty Jews left the city; 16 for the United States. On October 22, 1940, 16 Jews, Zweibruecken’s last, were deported to Gurs, France. At least 79 Zweibruecken Jews perished in the Shoah. After 1950, the synagogue changed ownership several times; the official regional Jewish community owned the site at one point, as did a Catholic order and, finally, a Protestant congregation. A plaque was unveiled at the site in 1970.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, FGW, LFD-RP, PJGH, SIA",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1400,1400
Zwesten,1646,89 in 1895 (10.9% of total population),46,"The Jewish community of Zwesten was established in the 17th or in the 18th century. Jews from nearby Niederuff (whose Jewish population in 1835 was 76), Oberuff (18 Jews in 1835) and Kerstenhausen eventually joined the Zwesten community. Zwesten’s synagogue on Schulstrasse, first mentioned in records from 1769, burned down in 1912, soon after which, in 1913, it was rebuilt; according to Paul Arnsberg and A. Frank, the synagogue was rebuilt in 1914-18. Other communal institutions included the following: a Jewish cemetery on Wildunger Strasse (established in 1730 and enlarged in 1820); a mikveh (1841); classrooms for religious instruction; and, finally, an elementary school (1876-1930). We also know that classes in religion were conducted in private homes and, later, on the upper floor of the synagogue building. In 1933, 46 Jews lived in Zwesten (19 in Niederuff). A teacher from Borken instructed six Jewish schoolchildren in religion, and several welfare organizations—a Gemilut Chessed charitable association, a chevra kadisha (established in 1859) and a ladies’ aid society (founded in 1876)—were active in the community. In 1933, a local Jew was arrested for engaging in ritual slaughter; later, in 1935, anti-Semites damaged Jewish homes in Zwesten and in Niederuff. On Pogrom Night (November 1938), SA and SS men destroyed the synagogue’s interior. Jewish homes were ransacked, Jews were assaulted, an elderly couple was forced to stand in an ice-cold brook for hours and Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The synagogue was later converted into a barn. By 1939, many Jewish residents had emigrated; others relocated within Germany. In 1941, Zwesten’s remaining Jews, a family, were deported to Riga. At least 25 Zwesten Jews perished in the Shoah, as did 11 from Niederuff and two from Kerstenhausen. The former synagogue building was torn down in 1968, and the site is now the location of a supermarket and some apartments. A memorial plaque was unveiled there in 1989.","Heidemarie Wawrzyn  Sources: AJ, DJGH, EJL, FGW, SFZ  regiowiki.hna.de/Bad_Zwesten",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1401,1401
Zuelz,15th century,"1,096 in 1812",12,"Jews—the first of whom were presumably from Bohemia and Moravia—lived in Zuelz (the city of Biala in today’s Poland) from the 15th century onwards. The oldest document referring to a Jewish presence in the town is dated 1543; at that time, all Zuelz’s Jewish residents were obliged to live together on one street. Zuelz was one of the few towns in Upper Silesia to develop a very large Jewish population; its Jews were shielded from persecution and expulsions by local rulers and, in 1699, they received a letter of protection from Kaiser Leopold himself. The towns of Zuelz and nearby Golgau (also in southwestern Poland) were the only places where Jews were given permission to stay even after the general expulsion of Jews from Silesia and Bohemia in 1582. This prompted significant growth of Zuelz’s Jewish community, and the town came to be known as “Zuelz of the Jews” (Judenzuelz in German; Makom Tzaddik in Hebrew). During the years 1780 to 1820, Jews made up 50% of Zuelz’s total population; in fact, for a time during the 18th century, the majority of Zuelz’s residents were Jewish. A report from 1688 mentions a wooden synagogue and a Jewish burial ground located outside town. A new Jewish cemetery was later established on Kopiec Hill; that cemetery was used by Jews from other communities in the area too (including the Jews of Breslau until 1761) and had to be extended at the end of the 17th century. Today it contains more than 3,000 graves. In addition to the wooden synagogue, the Zuelz community used a number of small prayer rooms, even after a proper synagogue was built in 1774. The new synagogue, a stone building with a beautiful facade, replaced the old wooden house of worship, which had been destroyed in a fire. The new synagogue was one of the largest in Germany at that time; it had seating for 300 men and 100 women. Initially Jewish education in Zuelz was offered only by a private school; in the 18th century, however, another school, accepting children from the town’s poorer Jewish families as well, was opened; its syllabus was dedicated almost exclusively to Jewish studies. The Zuelz Jews prospered and their community continued to grow until the late 17th century. In the 18th century, their economic situation deteriorated significantly; by that time they were living in cramped conditions, most of them in rented accommodation. The majority made an income through petty trade and peddling wares at weekly and annual markets, and only very few Jewish families were financially secure. From the 19th century onwards, local Jews began leaving in search of better economic opportunities. This decrease in the Jewish population improved relations between Jews and Christians in Zuelz, which, due to economic tensions, had been strained for some time. The Jews who stayed in Zuelz did better financially, and this benefitted the entire town. Nevertheless, owing to the sharp decrease in its Jewish population, after 1812, Zuelz lost its status as an important center for Silesian Jewry. By 1840, only 755 Jews still lived there; this number continued to fall and, in 1914, Zuelz’s Jewish now-small community lost its independence and was affiliated with the congregation in Neustadt; the synagogue in Zuelz was sold that year. By that time Jewish community life in the town had ceased almost completely. In the years 1925 to 1935 only 12 Jews lived in Zuelz. It is not known what happened to them under the Nazis; however, we do know that the former synagogue was burned down on Pogrom Night, November 1938, and was demolished completely in 1939. Today, a children’s playground is located where the synagogue once stood; as of this writing, no commemorative plaque has ever been erected there.","Bronagh Bowerman  Sources: EJL, LJG  www.sztetl.org.pl/",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1399,1399
Zwickau,14th century,496 in 1925,460,"After 1330, Jews lived on Zwickau’s Judengasse, or “Jews’ alley” (present-day Heinrichstrasse). A prayer room, thought to have been established a street called the Judenstrasse (Jews’ street”) in, at the latest, 1450, was destroyed in 1504. In 1543, after a series of brief periods of expulsion, Jews were banned from living in the town for 300 years. It was only between the years 1870 and 1875 that a Jewish presence was re-established in Zwickau. The modern Jewish community, founded in 1904, inaugurated a large prayer room on June 15, 1905; the prayer room, located in the annex of a house at 8, Bahnhofstrasse, seated 130 worshipers. The community maintained a mikveh and a Jewish cemetery, the latter of which was opened at the corner of Thurmer Strasse and Schneppendorfer Strasse in 1905. At the beginning of the 1920s, newly arrived Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe founded the Adass Jisroel congregation, whose prayer room was located at 10 Burgstrasse. By 1925, the Jewish community had grown to almost 500 members (approximately 0.5% of the total population), many of whom were owners of small shops, salesmen and peddlers. Several charitable and social organizations— including a branch of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith and, after 1912, a branch of the German Zionist Organization—were active in Zwickau. The well-known publisher and philanthropist Salman Schocken (1877-1959) lived in Zwickau; an active Zionist, he worked tirelessly during the Nazi period in helping Jews immigrate to Palestine. In October 1938, 68 Zwickau Jews of Polish origin were deported to Poland. Later that year, on Pogrom Night, SA men vandalized Jewish homes and shops; one hundred Jewish men were arrested and sent to Buchenwald. The prayer room was spared that night, but would be destroyed by the Nazis three years later. Sixty-four Jews lived in Zwickau in 1939. In October 1941, all but 15 of the town’s remaining Jews (they were, presumably, protected by their marriages to Christians) were deported to the East. The Burgstrasse prayer room and the cemetery hall were burned down, and the inscriptions on Jewish tombstones were removed. At least 79 Zwickau Jews perished in the Shoah. At the Jewish cemetery—several Russian-Jewish POWs from World War I are buried there—one will find 64 intact tombstones and a memorial to Zwickau’s murdered Jews. Severely vandalized in 2003, the cemetery was later restored. In memory of the Orthodox prayer room, a memorial plaque has been affixed to the sidewalk on Katharinenstrasse. In 2002, Torah scrolls were discovered in Zwickau’s Ratschul Library.","Beate Grosz-Wenker  Sources: AJ, EJL, LJG, W-G, YV",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1402,1402
Zwingenberg,1312,77 in 1880,40,"Although Jews were persecuted in Zwingenberg during the Black Death pogroms of 1348/49, a new Jewish presence was established in the town’s Judengasse (“Jews’ alley”) several decades later. Jews were expelled from the town in 1567, but those who lived there during the 17th century managed to establish the foundations of the modern Jewish community. The Jews of Zwingenberg—initially members of a joint community with the Jews of Alsbach, Bickenbach, Haehnlein and Jugenheim—formed their own independent Jewish community in 1858. The Zwingenberg community established a synagogue whose building also housed a school in 1861 (renovated in 1887); in 1903, one year after the building burned down in a neighborhood fire, a new synagogue was built at 5 Wiesenstrasse. Seven Jewish schoolchildren studied religion in Zwingenberg in 1933. Later, on Pogrom Night (November 1938), the synagogue’s windows were smashed; the Torah scrolls and ritual objects, however, had been transferred to Frankfurt before the pogrom. The two remaining Jewishowned homes were severely damaged that night. Eighteen Jews emigrated and 34 relocated within Germany. Zwingenberg’s last Jews left in June 1939. At least 21 Zwingenberg Jews perished in the Shoah. The synagogue building, which the Jewish community was forced to sell after Pogrom Night, was used as a warehouse and, later, as a residence. Memorial plaques have been unveiled at the former synagogue site and at the town hall.","Nurit Borut  Sources: AJ, EJL, PK-HNF",http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?sid=1403,1403
